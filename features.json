User management is essential for any application requiring user accounts, profiles, and access control.\n**Implementation Effort**: Medium - builds on existing OAuth infrastructure\n**Dependencies**: OAuth 2.0 authentication system (already implemented), database schema design\n**Proposed by**: development_session_1756276145521_1_general_dece607d on 2025-08-27\n\n```markdown"
