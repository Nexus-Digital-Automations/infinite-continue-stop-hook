Add phases field to FEATURE objects ONLY in TODO.json structure\n2. Update TaskManager API to support phase creation/management for FEATURE TASKS ONLY\n3. Add phase progression logic (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3) for FEATURE TASKS ONLY\n4. Update API endpoints to handle phase queries/updates for FEATURE TASKS ONLY\n5. Add phase validation and timeline tracking for FEATURE TASKS ONLY\n6. Update ALL documentation and guides:\n   - taskmanager-api.js internal guide system\n   - docs/ directory documentation files\n   - API reference documentation\n   - User guides and examples\n   - Troubleshooting guides\n   - Update guide responses to include phase system info\n\nPhases: Simple numbering (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, etc.)\nPurpose: Track FEATURE development timeline and phase dependencies\n\nEXCLUSIVE SCOPE: Error tasks, subtask tasks, and test tasks should NEVER have phases - phases are FEATURE-ONLY functionality.",
