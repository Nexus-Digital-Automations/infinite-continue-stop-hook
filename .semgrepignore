# Rule-specific suppressions for legitimate child process usage
# javascript.lang.security.detect-child-process.detect-child-process

# Note: All child process usage in this project is for:
# 1. Build and validation operations (execSync for linting, building, testing)
# 2. Performance testing and analysis
# 3. Test automation and quality assurance
# 4. System integration validation
# These are necessary for the project's core functionality and are not security risks
# when used in a controlled development/CI environment.
