# Claude Code Project Assistant - Streamlined Guide

<law>
CORE OPERATION PRINCIPLES (Display at start of every response):
1. ABSOLUTE HONESTY - Never skip, ignore, or hide ANY issues, errors, or failures
2. ROOT PROBLEM SOLVING - Fix underlying causes, not symptoms
3. IMMEDIATE TASK EXECUTION - Initialize ‚Üí Create ‚Üí Execute (no delays)
4. TASKMANAGER API EXCLUSIVE - Never read TODO.json directly
5. COMPLETE EVERY TASK - One at a time, commit and push before completion
6. CLAUDE.md PROTECTION - NEVER EVER EVER EDIT CLAUDE.md WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION
7. ABSOLUTE CLAUDE.md COMPLIANCE - It is an ABSOLUTE MANDATE to follow ALL CLAUDE.md instructions
</law>

## üö® ABSOLUTE MANDATE - CLAUDE.md COMPLIANCE

**üî¥ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - FOLLOW ALL CLAUDE.md INSTRUCTIONS:**

**ABSOLUTE MANDATE:**
- **‚úÖ MANDATORY COMPLIANCE** - ALL agents MUST follow EVERY instruction in CLAUDE.md without exception
- **‚úÖ ZERO TOLERANCE** - No deviation, ignoring, or selective compliance with CLAUDE.md directives
- **‚úÖ COMPLETE ADHERENCE** - Every protocol, procedure, and requirement in CLAUDE.md is binding
- **‚úÖ IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION** - All CLAUDE.md instructions take effect immediately upon reading

**COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS:**
- **üìñ READ THOROUGHLY** - Agents must read and understand ALL CLAUDE.md sections
- **üéØ FOLLOW PRECISELY** - Execute ALL protocols and procedures exactly as specified
- **‚ö° IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY** - No delays or selective interpretation of instructions
- **üîÑ CONTINUOUS ADHERENCE** - Maintain compliance throughout entire task execution

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:**
Any failure to follow CLAUDE.md instructions is considered a critical operational failure and undermines the entire project management system.

**ENFORCEMENT:**
- All agents are bound by CLAUDE.md instructions
- No agent may ignore or override CLAUDE.md directives
- User instructions AND CLAUDE.md instructions must both be followed
- When conflicts arise, seek clarification rather than ignore either directive

## üîí CRITICAL SECURITY MANDATE - CLAUDE.md PROTECTION

**üö® ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION - NEVER EDIT CLAUDE.md WITHOUT USER PERMISSION:**

**MANDATORY SECURITY RULE:**
- **‚ùå NEVER EVER EVER** edit, modify, or change CLAUDE.md without explicit user permission and approval
- **‚ùå NEVER** suggest changes to CLAUDE.md unless specifically asked by the user
- **‚ùå NEVER** make "improvements" or "optimizations" to CLAUDE.md on your own initiative
- **‚ùå NEVER** add, remove, or modify any sections of CLAUDE.md without direct user instruction

**ONLY AUTHORIZED ACTIONS:**
- **‚úÖ READ** CLAUDE.md to understand and follow instructions
- **‚úÖ REFERENCE** CLAUDE.md content in responses when relevant
- **‚úÖ EXPLAIN** CLAUDE.md rules when asked by user
- **‚úÖ EDIT** CLAUDE.md ONLY when user explicitly requests specific changes

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:**
Any unauthorized modification of CLAUDE.md is considered a critical security violation and undermines the entire project instruction system.

**USER PERMISSION REQUIRED:**
Before making ANY changes to CLAUDE.md, agents must:
1. Receive explicit user request to modify CLAUDE.md
2. Confirm the specific changes requested
3. Get user approval before implementing changes
4. Document the user authorization in commit messages

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION PROTOCOL
**MANDATORY SEQUENCE FOR ALL USER REQUESTS:**
1. **INITIALIZE** - `timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js init`
2. **CREATE TASK** - `timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js create '{"title":"[Request]", "description":"[Details]", "category":"error|feature|subtask|test"}'`
3. **AGENT PLANNING** - Think about task complexity and MANDATORY communicate approach to user
   - **SIMPLE TASKS**: "Handling this solo" for straightforward single-component work
   - **COMPLEX TASKS**: "Using X concurrent agents" (2-10) for multi-component/complex work
   - **DECISION CRITERIA**: Multi-file changes, research + implementation, testing + docs = concurrent agents
   - **MANDATORY COMMUNICATION**: ALWAYS tell user exactly how many subagents will be deployed before starting
4. **EXECUTE** - Begin implementation immediately

**ZERO DELAY MANDATE:**
- **‚ùå NO**: Analysis first, "let me check" responses, preliminary questions
- **‚úÖ YES**: Instant response ‚Üí Initialize ‚Üí Create task ‚Üí Execute
- **TRIGGERS**: Any request to implement, add, create, fix, improve, analyze, work on anything, or "continue"
- **USER REQUEST SUPREMACY**: User requests are HIGHEST PRIORITY - above all tasks including errors. Execute immediately using protocols

**STOP HOOK FEEDBACK EVALUATION:**
- **AFTER STOP HOOK FEEDBACK**: Think and evaluate whether task was fully and comprehensively completed
- **INCOMPLETE DETECTION**: If task not fully/comprehensively completed, continue working immediately
- **COMPREHENSIVE COMPLETION**: Ensure all aspects of request fulfilled before stopping

## üö® MANDATORY USAGE TRACKING PROTOCOL
**REINITIALIZE AFTER EVERY USER MESSAGE AND STOP HOOK**

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- **AFTER USER MESSAGE**: Always run reinitialize before starting any work on user requests
- **AFTER STOP HOOK**: Always run reinitialize before continuing work after stop hook feedback
- **USAGE TRACKING**: All init/reinitialize calls are automatically tracked in 5-hour windows starting at 11AM CDT
- **ANALYTICS ACCESS**: Use `usage-analytics` endpoint to monitor usage patterns and compliance

**MANDATORY COMMANDS:**
```bash
# Reinitialize with your agent ID (REQUIRED after every user message/stop hook)
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js reinitialize <agentId>

# Check usage analytics (optional - for monitoring compliance)
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js usage-analytics
```

**COMPLIANCE TRACKING:**
- **5-HOUR WINDOWS**: Usage tracked in 5-hour increments: 11am-4pm, 4pm-9pm, 9pm-2am, 2am-7am, 7am-12pm
- **AUTOMATIC MONITORING**: System automatically counts all initialization calls per window
- **ANALYTICS REPORTING**: Current and previous window statistics available via usage-analytics command
- **NON-BLOCKING**: Usage tracking failures do not prevent normal TaskManager operations

**ENFORCEMENT:**
This protocol ensures consistent agent lifecycle management and provides usage insights for system optimization. All agents must comply with this mandatory reinitialization requirement.

### üß† RAG-FIRST LEARNING PROTOCOLS
**PRIMARY KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

**RAG SYSTEM OVERVIEW:**
The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system is the primary knowledge management system, providing intelligent lesson storage, semantic search, automatic categorization, and cross-project learning capabilities. All knowledge storage and retrieval operations use RAG commands exclusively.

**MANDATORY RAG WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:**

**PRE-TASK PREPARATION PROTOCOL:**
```bash
# 1. RAG Health Check (mandatory before any work)
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-health

# 2. Query Relevant Lessons (replaces file scanning)
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-get-relevant "$(echo $TASK_DESCRIPTION)"

# 3. Find Similar Errors (for error tasks only)
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-similar-errors "$(echo $ERROR_DESCRIPTION)"
```

**DURING TASK EXECUTION:**
- **AUTOMATIC LESSON STORAGE**: Store insights immediately when discovered
- **PATTERN APPLICATION**: Apply retrieved lesson patterns to current implementation
- **SOLUTION TRACKING**: Document approach reasoning for future reference
- **ERROR RESOLUTION**: Store error solutions with context for pattern recognition

**REAL-TIME LESSON CAPTURE:**
```bash
# Store lesson immediately when solution is found
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-store-lesson '{
  "title": "Solution for specific problem",
  "content": "Detailed solution explanation",
  "category": "errors|features|optimization|decisions|patterns",
  "context": {"taskId": "'$CURRENT_TASK_ID'", "approach": "solution_method"}
}'
```

**POST-TASK COMPLETION:**
```bash
# Store completion lesson with effectiveness tracking
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-store-lesson '{
  "title": "Task completion: '$TASK_TITLE'",
  "content": "Approach used, challenges overcome, results achieved",
  "category": "'$TASK_CATEGORY'",
  "metadata": {"effectiveness": 1.0, "timeToComplete": "'$DURATION'"}
}'
```

**RAG SEARCH STRATEGIES:**
- **SEMANTIC QUERIES**: Use natural language descriptions of problems
- **CONTEXTUAL SEARCH**: Include technology stack and project context
- **SIMILARITY THRESHOLDS**: Adjust for precision (0.8+) vs recall (0.6+)
- **CATEGORY FILTERING**: Focus on specific lesson types when needed

**LESSON QUALITY STANDARDS:**
- **SPECIFICITY**: Include exact error messages, file paths, and solutions
- **CONTEXT**: Store relevant project information and technical details
- **ACTIONABILITY**: Document clear steps and prevention strategies
- **EFFECTIVENESS**: Track and update lesson success rates

**CROSS-PROJECT LEARNING:**

- **CLEANUP**: Archive original files after successful migration

### ‚ö° SCOPE CONTROL & AUTHORIZATION
**NO UNAUTHORIZED SCOPE EXPANSION**

**SCOPE RESTRICTION PROTOCOL:**
- **WORK ONLY ON EXISTING TODO.json FEATURES** - Never create new features beyond what already exists
- **COMPLETE EXISTING WORK FIRST** - Focus on finishing tasks already in TODO.json before considering anything new
- **FINISH WHAT'S STARTED** - Complete existing tasks rather than starting new initiatives

**RULES:**
- **‚ùå NEVER**: Create feature tasks without explicit user request, expand scope beyond description, implement "suggested" features, add "convenient" improvements
- **‚ùå NEVER**: Create error tasks or test tasks for outdated/deprecated materials - remove them instead
- **‚úÖ ONLY**: Implement features explicitly requested by user or existing in TODO.json with "pending" or "approved" status
- **‚úÖ FOCUS**: Complete existing TODO.json tasks before considering new work

**FEATURE PROTOCOL:**
- **EXISTING ONLY**: Only work on features that already exist in the project's TODO.json
- **NO NEW FEATURES**: Do not create, suggest, or implement new features unless explicitly requested by user
- **DOCUMENT SUGGESTIONS**: If you have feature ideas, document in `development/essentials/features.md` with "SUGGESTION" status and wait for explicit user authorization

**SCOPE VALIDATION CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] Is this feature already in TODO.json? (If no, stop - do not implement)
- [ ] Did user explicitly request this new feature? (If no, stop - do not implement) 
- [ ] Are there existing TODO.json tasks to complete first? (If yes, work on those instead)
- [ ] Am I expanding scope beyond what was requested? (If yes, stop - stick to original scope)

## üö® QUALITY CONTROL & STANDARDS

### CODE STANDARDS
**QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:**

function processData(userId, data) {
    const logger = getLogger('DataProcessor');
    logger.info(`Starting`, {userId, dataSize: data.length});
    try {
        const result = transformData(data);
        logger.info(`Completed in ${Date.now() - start}ms`);
        return result;
    } catch (error) {
        logger.error(`Failed`, {error: error.message});
        throw error;
    }
}
```

2. **ERROR TASKS** - Linter > build > start > runtime bugs
3. **FEATURE TASKS** - Only after errors resolved, linear order
4. **TEST TASKS** - Prohibited until all errors and approved features complete

**COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ONE AT A TIME**: Complete current task before starting new ones
- **NO ABANDONMENT**: Work through difficulties, finish what you start
- **SAFE FORMATTING**: Use simple quoted strings: `'"Task completed successfully"'`
- **NO SPECIAL CHARACTERS**: Avoid emojis, !, ‚úÖ in completion messages

### GIT WORKFLOW - MANDATORY COMMIT/PUSH
**ALL WORK MUST BE COMMITTED AND PUSHED BEFORE COMPLETION**

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- **‚úÖ ALWAYS**: Commit all changes, push to remote, use descriptive messages, atomic commits
- **‚ùå NEVER**: Leave uncommitted changes or unpushed commits when marking complete
- **CI/CD PIPELINE**: All commits must pass automated pipeline (lint, test, build, security scans)
- **BRANCH PROTECTION**: Main branch requires PR approval + status checks passing

**SEQUENCE:**
```bash
git add .                                    # Stage changes
git commit -m "[type]: [description]"        # Commit with standard type
git push                                     # Push to remote
git status                                   # Verify clean/up-to-date
```

**COMMIT TYPES:** feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, style

**VERIFICATION:** Clean working directory + "up to date with origin/main" + document evidence

**TROUBLESHOOTING:** Conflicts ‚Üí resolve + commit + push; Rejected ‚Üí pull + merge + push; Untracked ‚Üí add important files; Large files ‚Üí use git LFS

## üö® CONCURRENT SUBAGENT DEPLOYMENT
**üî¥ MAXIMIZE DEPLOYMENT (UP TO 10 AGENTS)**

**PROTOCOL:**
- **MANDATORY DECLARATION**: ALWAYS tell user "Deploying X concurrent agents" before starting
- **EXPLICIT COUNT**: State exact number of subagents (e.g., "Using 5 concurrent agents", "Deploying 3 agents")
- **SIMULTANEOUS START**: All agents via ONE tool call with multiple invokes
- **STRATEGIC COUNT**: Maximum meaningful number (2-10) for complex tasks
- **ASSESS ALL TASKS**: Evaluate parallelization potential
- **USER COMMUNICATION**: NEVER deploy subagents without first informing the user of the count

**USAGE:** Multi-component tasks (research + implementation + testing + docs), large refactoring, multi-file implementations

**SPECIALIZATIONS:** Development (Frontend/Backend/Database/DevOps/Security/Performance/Documentation), Testing (Unit/Integration/E2E/Performance/Security/Accessibility), Research (Technology/API/Performance/Security/Architecture)

**AVOID:** Single agent fallback when multiple supported, sequential deployment instead of concurrent
