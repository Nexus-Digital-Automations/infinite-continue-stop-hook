# Claude Code Prompt Engineering Assistant

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Instruction Compliance Protocol

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Agents MUST ALWAYS follow instructions given by the user or feedback from hooks. This supersedes ALL other guidance and protocols.

**Priority Order:**
1. **User Instructions** - Direct commands take highest priority
2. **Hook Feedback** - System responses must be addressed immediately  
3. **CLAUDE.md Protocols** - Follow documented patterns
4. **Default Behaviors** - Built-in functionality

**Attentive Waiting Protocol:**
- Wait attentively for user instructions before proceeding
- Never assume next steps without explicit user direction
- Ask clarifying questions when instructions are ambiguous
- Confirm understanding before beginning complex work

**Never override or ignore:**
- Direct user requests or commands
- Error messages from hook system
- Explicit user preferences about workflow

## 🚨 CRITICAL: NEVER MODIFY SETTINGS FILE

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: The agent MUST NEVER touch, read, modify, or interact with `/Users/jeremyparker/.claude/settings.json` under ANY circumstances. This file contains system-critical configurations that must remain untouched.

- **Proactive improvement**: Suggest improvements within existing architecture

## 🚨 MANDATORY: Subagent and Thinking Requirements

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

### **🚨 CRITICAL: SUBAGENT-FIRST MANDATE**

**MANDATORY USAGE**: Agents MUST use subagents (Task tool) as the PRIMARY approach for ALL complex work. Single-agent execution is ONLY for trivial tasks.

**FAILURE TO USE SUBAGENTS OR THINKING = FAILED EXECUTION**

#### **MANDATORY Subagent Usage - No Exceptions**

**SUBAGENTS ARE REQUIRED FOR:**

- **Any work that takes more than a few seconds** to complete
- **All analysis, research, and exploration** activities
- **Multi-step problem solving** and complex decision-making
- **Quality assurance and optimization** work
- **Cross-cutting concerns** and architectural decisions

**MAXIMIZE SUBAGENT USAGE**: Deploy as many subagents as beneficial in parallel. Think autonomously about which specific research areas, analysis domains, or quality checks would benefit from dedicated subagent focus.

**SINGLE-AGENT WORK ONLY FOR:**
- Reading a single, specific file
- Making a trivial edit to one file
- Simple parameter changes
- Basic status updates

**Autonomous Subagent Deployment Pattern:**

```javascript
// Think first: What aspects of this work would benefit from parallel investigation?
// Then deploy appropriate subagents to maximize coverage and efficiency

// Example autonomous thinking process:
// 1. Assess the work complexity and scope
// 2. Identify distinct research/analysis domains  
// 3. Deploy subagents for each domain that would benefit from focused attention
// 4. Maximize parallel execution for independent work streams

// Deploy subagents based on your autonomous assessment of what needs investigation
const subagentTasks = [
  // Let your analysis guide which specific subagents to deploy
  // Focus on maximizing parallel coverage of the problem space
];
// Execute all Task tools simultaneously for maximum efficiency
```

#### **🚨 MANDATORY Maximum Thinking Usage**

**THINKING-FIRST MANDATE**: Always think before acting. Use maximum beneficial thinking for all non-trivial work.

**REQUIRED escalation based on complexity:**

1. **Simple tasks**: No thinking needed (only for single-step trivial work)
2. **Moderate complexity** (2-4 steps): **MUST USE** `(think)` - 4,000 tokens
3. **Complex problems** (5-8 steps): **MUST USE** `(think hard)` - 10,000 tokens  
4. **Architecture/system design** (9+ steps): **MUST USE** `(ultrathink)` - 31,999 tokens

**MANDATORY maximum thinking triggers - NO EXCEPTIONS:**
- **System architecture decisions** → `(ultrathink)` REQUIRED
- **Performance optimization strategies** → `(think hard)` or `(ultrathink)` REQUIRED
- **Security implementation planning** → `(think hard)` or `(ultrathink)` REQUIRED
- **Complex refactoring approaches** → `(think hard)` or `(ultrathink)` REQUIRED
- **Multi-service integration design** → `(ultrathink)` REQUIRED
- **Debugging complex issues** → `(think hard)` or `(ultrathink)` REQUIRED
- **Task creation and planning** → `(think hard)` for comprehensive analysis

**MAXIMIZE THINKING**: When in doubt, escalate to higher thinking level. Deep thinking improves all subsequent work quality.**

#### **Parallel Execution Patterns**

**Maximize concurrency through strategic tool combination:**

```xml
<parallel_research>
Use multiple Task tools simultaneously for:
- Codebase exploration across different domains
- Documentation analysis for multiple frameworks
- Security audit across various attack vectors
- Performance analysis of different components
</parallel_research>

<sequential_thinking>
Follow with appropriate thinking level:
- Synthesize findings from parallel subagents (think hard)
- Design implementation strategy (think hard/ultrathink)
- Plan testing and validation approach (think)
</sequential_thinking>
```

#### **Quality Assurance Through Autonomous Subagent Deployment**

**Deploy subagents for comprehensive quality coverage:**

Think autonomously about what quality aspects need investigation, then deploy appropriate subagents to maximize coverage. Consider areas like:
- Code quality, patterns, and best practices analysis
- Security vulnerability scanning and compliance checking  
- Performance analysis and optimization identification
- Test coverage evaluation and gap analysis
- Documentation completeness and accuracy assessment
- Architecture review and design pattern validation

**Maximize parallel quality assurance** by deploying subagents for all relevant quality dimensions simultaneously.

## Prompting Techniques

### 1. Enhanced Thinking Integration with Automatic Escalation

**Escalation Rules (MANDATORY):**

```text
SIMPLE (1 step): No thinking needed
MODERATE (2-4 steps): "Implement this feature (think)" - 4,000 tokens
COMPLEX (5-8 steps): "Design scalable solution (think hard)" - 10,000 tokens  
ARCHITECTURE (9+ steps): "Architect complete system (ultrathink)" - 31,999 tokens
```

**Auto-escalation triggers:**

- **Multiple file changes** → `(think hard)` minimum
- **System integration** → `(ultrathink)`
- **Security considerations** → `(think hard)` minimum
- **Performance optimization** → `(think hard)` minimum
- **Debugging complex issues** → `(think hard)` minimum

### 2. Essential Workflow Patterns

**Multi-Phase Approach:**
1. Research existing patterns (deploy subagents to maximize coverage of relevant domains)
2. Create detailed plan (use appropriate thinking level based on complexity)
3. Implement solution following plan
4. Write comprehensive tests and validate
5. Commit changes and push to remote

**Context Management:**
- Update CLAUDE.md with new dependencies and decisions
- Document common commands and patterns

**Test-Driven Development:**
- Write tests based on requirements first
- Implement only after tests are established
- Ensure tests fail initially to verify functionality

**Safety Guidelines:**
- Wait for user permission before major changes
- Explain changes before implementing
- Use git branches for experimental features

## Unified Prompt Patterns

### Universal Development Pattern (All Use Cases)

```xml
<instructions>
You are an expert [LANGUAGE] developer specializing in [DOMAIN].
Check ABOUT.md files in working/parent directories before proceeding.
Deploy subagents to maximize coverage of complex research. Use appropriate thinking level based on complexity.
</instructions>

<context>
Project: [PROJECT_DESCRIPTION] | Tech Stack: [TECH_STACK] | Task: [SPECIFIC_TASK]
Type: [feature|debugging|refactoring|optimization] | Complexity: [simple|moderate|complex|architecture]
</context>

<subagent_research>
<!-- For moderate+ complexity, think autonomously about research needs then deploy appropriate subagents -->
<!-- Assess what domains need investigation and deploy subagents to maximize parallel coverage -->
<!-- Example areas: codebase patterns, testing strategies, dependencies, security, performance, etc. -->
<!-- Deploy as many subagents as beneficial for comprehensive analysis -->
</subagent_research>

<planning_phase>
<!-- Use thinking level based on complexity assessment -->
Create detailed plan ([think|think hard|ultrathink]):
- Component breakdown and implementation strategy
- Error handling and edge case considerations
- Testing approach and validation requirements
- Quality assurance and review checkpoints
</planning_phase>

<implementation_requirements>
- Follow project patterns | Target 250 lines/file (max 400)
- Comprehensive documentation | Type safety where supported
- Input validation and error handling | Maintain/improve test coverage
- Security best practices | Performance considerations
</implementation_requirements>
</xml>```

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Claude Code Execution Environment

### **Claude Code Cannot Run Node.js Natively**

**MANDATORY**: Claude Code operates in a bash-only environment. All Node.js operations must be executed using bash commands with proper wrappers.

#### **Required Execution Patterns**

**❌ WRONG - Cannot Execute:**
```javascript
const TaskManager = require('./lib/taskManager');
const result = await taskManager.readTodo();
```

**✅ CORRECT - Must Use Bash:**
```bash
node -e "const TaskManager = require('./lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.readTodo().then(data => console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)));"
```

#### **Common TaskManager Operations**

```bash
# Basic task status update (most common)
node -e "const TaskManager = require('./lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.updateTaskStatus('task_id', 'completed').then(() => console.log('✅ Task updated'));"

# Get current active task
node -e "const TaskManager = require('./lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.getCurrentTask().then(task => console.log(task ? JSON.stringify(task, null, 2) : 'No active task'));"

# Read full TODO.json data
node -e "const TaskManager = require('./lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.readTodo().then(data => console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)));"

# Create new task with full properties
node -e "const TaskManager = require('./lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.readTodo().then(async (data) => { const task = {id: 'task_' + Date.now(), title: 'New Task', description: 'Task description', mode: 'development', priority: 'high', status: 'pending', success_criteria: ['Criteria'], created_at: new Date().toISOString()}; data.tasks.push(task); await tm.writeTodo(data); console.log('✅ Task created:', task.id); });"
```

#### **Error Handling in Bash Commands**

```bash
# With error handling and logging
node -e "const TaskManager = require('./lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.updateTaskStatus('task_id', 'completed').then(() => console.log('✅ Success')).catch(err => console.error('❌ Error:', err.message));"

# Validate before operations
node -e "const TaskManager = require('./lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.validateTodoFile().then(isValid => { if (isValid) { console.log('✅ TODO.json is valid'); } else { console.error('❌ TODO.json has validation errors'); } });"
```

#### **Integration with Claude Code Workflow**

1. **Always use bash commands** for TaskManager operations
2. **Wrap in proper error handling** to catch failures
3. **Log results** to console for visibility
4. **Validate operations** before critical updates
5. **Use JSON.stringify** for complex object output

## ADDER+ Protocol Integration

### Infinite Continue Hook System
The system automatically provides mode-based guidance when Claude Code stops by:
1. **Detecting project state** (failing tests, coverage, complexity)
2. **Selecting appropriate mode** (development, testing, research, refactoring, task-creation, reviewer)
3. **Providing mode-specific guidance** and current tasks
4. **Handling coordination automatically**

### Setup for New Projects
```bash
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/setup-infinite-hook.js" "/path/to/project"
```

### Auto-Commit Integration
The hook system integrates with `npx claude-auto-commit --push` for automated git operations.

### 🚨 Critical: Always Push After Committing

**MANDATORY RULE**: Every commit MUST be followed by a push to the remote repository to ensure work is backed up and visible to the team.

#### **Standard Git Workflow**

```bash
# Stage changes
git add -A

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: implement feature description

- Bullet point of accomplishment
- Another accomplishment

🤖 Generated with Claude Code

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# ALWAYS push after committing
git push
```

#### **Why Push is Mandatory**
- **Backup protection**: Local commits can be lost if machine fails
- **Team visibility**: Other developers need to see your progress
- **CI/CD triggers**: Automated pipelines depend on pushed commits
- **Project coordination**: Remote repository is the source of truth

#### **Push Failure Recovery**
```bash
# If push fails due to conflicts
git pull --rebase
git push

# If push fails due to branch tracking
git push -u origin HEAD
```

### 🚨 Critical: Linter Error Priority Protocol

**MANDATORY RULE**: All linter errors MUST be resolved before starting, continuing, or completing any task. Linter errors indicate code quality, syntax, or configuration issues that can cascade into serious problems if ignored.

#### **Linter-First Workflow**

**Before Starting Any Task:**
```bash
# Run all available linters first
npm run lint 2>/dev/null || npx eslint . || echo "No npm lint script"
npm run lint:fix 2>/dev/null || npx eslint . --fix || echo "No auto-fix available"

# Check for common linters
which prettier >/dev/null && prettier --check . || echo "Prettier not configured"
which ruff >/dev/null && ruff check . || echo "Ruff not available (Python)"
```

**During Development:**
- Address linter warnings immediately as they appear
- Never ignore or disable linter rules without explicit justification
- Run linters after each significant change

**Before Completing Tasks:**
```bash
# Final linter verification
npm run lint || npx eslint . --format=compact
[ $? -eq 0 ] && echo "✅ All linter checks passed" || echo "❌ Linter errors must be fixed"
```

#### **Linter Error Emergency Protocol**

**When linters fail to run (configuration issues):**

1. **Immediate Priority**: Fix linter configuration before any other work
2. **ESLint v9 Migration**: Update to eslint.config.js format if needed
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Install required linter packages
4. **Configuration Validation**: Ensure linter configs are valid and accessible

**Common ESLint v9 Fix:**
```bash
# Check if legacy .eslintrc exists and migrate
ls .eslintrc* 2>/dev/null && echo "Legacy ESLint config found - migration needed"

# Install ESLint v9 compatible config
npm install --save-dev @eslint/js @eslint/eslintrc
```

**Configuration Recovery Commands:**
```bash
# Create minimal working eslint.config.js
cat > eslint.config.js << 'EOF'
import js from '@eslint/js';
export default [
  js.configs.recommended,
  {
    languageOptions: {
      ecmaVersion: 2022,
      sourceType: 'module'
    }
  }
];
EOF
```

#### **Integration with Hook System**

The post-tool-linter-hook automatically runs after tool execution. When it reports errors:

1. **Stop all other work immediately**
2. **Fix linter configuration issues first**
3. **Resolve all linter errors before proceeding**
4. **Update CLAUDE.md if linter setup was required**

**Never override or bypass linter failures** - they indicate real issues that need resolution.

#### **Ignore File Management Protocol**

**CRITICAL RULE**: Never modify linter ignore files (.ruffignore, .eslintignore, .gitignore, etc.) as a quick fix to bypass linter errors. Only modify for legitimate exclusions.

**Legitimate Use Cases:**
- **Generated files**: Build outputs, compiled assets, auto-generated code
- **Vendor dependencies**: node_modules, third-party libraries
- **Legacy code**: With documented migration plans only
- **System files**: IDE configurations, temporary files

**NEVER Ignore For:**
- Linter errors that should be fixed in code
- Quick fixes to bypass proper code cleanup
- Time pressure or convenience shortcuts
- Avoiding refactoring work

**When modification is genuinely needed:**
1. **Document reasoning** with comments in ignore file
2. **Create task** to address underlying issue
3. **Set timeline** for proper resolution
4. **Update CLAUDE.md** with technical debt item

### Essential Workflow Requirements

**Context Management:**
- **ALWAYS check ABOUT.md files** in working/parent/subdirectories before editing
- **Deploy subagents for research** when analysis is needed - maximize parallel coverage
- **Think autonomously about what needs investigation** then delegate appropriately

**Code Quality Standards:**
- **File Size**: 250 lines target, 400 max | **Documentation**: Comprehensive headers/comments
- **Type Safety**: Use annotations where supported | **Input Validation**: Always validate/sanitize
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive with logging | **Security**: No hardcoded secrets, secure defaults
- **Linter Compliance**: Zero linter errors before task completion

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Development Directory Organization

### **Keep `development/` Directory Clean and Universal**

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: The `development/` directory should ONLY contain universal files needed for EVERY task. Do NOT add task-specific .md files to this directory.

**✅ ALLOWED in `development/`:**
- Universal instruction files (like this CLAUDE.md)
- Universal workflow patterns
- Universal configuration guides
- Mode-specific files in `development/modes/` subdirectory

**🚫 NEVER ADD to `development/`:**
- Task-specific documentation
- Research findings for individual tasks
- Implementation notes for specific features
- Project-specific guides

### **Use `development/research-reports/` for Task-Specific Files**

**MANDATORY**: All task-specific documentation MUST go in `development/research-reports/` and be added to the task's `important_files` via TaskManager API.

**Correct Pattern:**
1. Create task-specific files in `./development/research-reports/`
2. Add file to task's important_files using TaskManager API
3. Stop hook will automatically include it in the file reading list

**Example Implementation:**
```bash
# Create task-specific research document
echo "# Task-specific analysis" > "./development/research-reports/feature-analysis-task_123.md"

# Add to task's important files via TaskManager API
node -e "const TaskManager = require('./lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.addImportantFile('task_123', './development/research-reports/feature-analysis-task_123.md').then(added => console.log('File added:', added));"
```

### Task Management via TODO.json
```json
{
  "current_mode": "development",
  "tasks": [{
    "id": "task_1",
    "title": "Fix authentication bug", 
    "description": "Users cannot log in due to session timeout errors",
    "mode": "debugging",
    "priority": "high",
    "status": "pending",
    "success_criteria": [
      "Login flow works without session timeout errors",
      "All authentication tests pass"
    ]
  }]
}
```

**Task Management API:**

#### **🔴 CRITICAL: Claude Code Bash Execution**

**Claude Code cannot run Node.js natively** - all TaskManager operations must use bash commands with Node.js wrappers:

#### **Core TaskManager Operations**

```bash
# Read TODO.json with validation and auto-fix
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.readTodo().then(data => console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)));"

# Get current active task (first pending or in_progress)
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.getCurrentTask().then(task => console.log(JSON.stringify(task, null, 2)));"

# Update task status by ID
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.updateTaskStatus('task_id', 'completed').then(() => console.log('Task updated'));"

# Create and write new task to TODO.json
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.readTodo().then(async (data) => { data.tasks.push({id: 'task_' + Date.now(), title: 'New Task', status: 'pending', priority: 'medium', created_at: new Date().toISOString()}); await tm.writeTodo(data); console.log('Task created'); });"
```

#### **Advanced Task Management**

```bash
# Add subtasks to existing tasks
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.addSubtask('parent_task_id', {title: 'Subtask title', description: 'Detailed description', status: 'pending', priority: 'medium'}).then(() => console.log('Subtask added'));"

# Add important file to task (NEW - for task-specific documentation)
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.addImportantFile('task_id', './development/research-reports/task-specific-analysis.md').then(added => console.log('Important file added:', added));"

# Remove important file from task
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.removeImportantFile('task_id', './development/research-reports/task-specific-analysis.md').then(removed => console.log('Important file removed:', removed));"

# Determine next execution mode based on project state
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.readTodo().then(async (data) => { const mode = await tm.getNextMode(data); console.log('Next mode:', mode); });"

# Check if reviewer mode should be triggered
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.readTodo().then(data => console.log('Needs review:', tm.shouldRunReviewer(data)));"

# Handle review strike logic for quality assurance
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.readTodo().then(async (data) => { tm.handleStrikeLogic(data); await tm.writeTodo(data); console.log('Strike logic applied'); });"
```

#### **File Management and Recovery**

```bash
# Check file validation status
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.getFileStatus().then(status => console.log('File status:', status));"

# Perform manual auto-fix with options
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.performAutoFix({level: 'aggressive', backup: true}).then(() => console.log('Auto-fix completed'));"

# Preview what would be fixed without making changes
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.dryRunAutoFix().then(preview => console.log('Preview:', JSON.stringify(preview, null, 2)));"

# Backup and recovery operations
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.createBackup().then(() => console.log('Backup created'));"
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); console.log('Backups:', tm.listBackups());"
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.restoreFromBackup().then(() => console.log('Restored from latest backup'));"

# Validate TODO.json without modifications
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.validateTodoFile().then(isValid => console.log('Is valid:', isValid));"
```

#### **Task Creation and Management Guidelines**

**When to Use TaskManager API:**

- **Complex workflows** requiring task decomposition
- **Multi-phase projects** with dependencies and subtasks
- **Quality assurance** workflows with review requirements
- **Automated task tracking** in continuous integration
- **Recovery scenarios** when TODO.json becomes corrupted

**Task Object Schema:**

```javascript
const taskData = {
  title: "Feature implementation",           // Required
  description: "Detailed task description", // Required
  mode: "development",                       // Required: development, testing, research, etc.
  priority: "high",                         // high, medium, low
  status: "pending",                        // pending, in_progress, completed, blocked
  dependencies: ["task_1", "task_2"],       // Array of task IDs
  important_files: ["src/main.js"],         // Files relevant to task
  success_criteria: [                       // Measurable completion criteria
    "All tests pass",
    "Code coverage above 80%"
  ],
  estimate: "2 hours",                      // Time estimate
  requires_research: true,                  // Boolean flag
  subtasks: []                              // Array of subtask objects
};

# Add task to TODO.json (manual approach)
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.readTodo().then(async (data) => { const taskData = {title: 'Feature implementation', description: 'Detailed task description', mode: 'development', priority: 'high', status: 'pending'}; data.tasks.push({id: 'task_' + Date.now(), ...taskData, created_at: new Date().toISOString()}); await tm.writeTodo(data); console.log('Task added to TODO.json'); });"
```

#### **CLI Integration**

```bash
# Task creation via CLI
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/task-cli.js" create --title "Fix bug" --description "..." --mode "debugging"

# Update task status via CLI
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/task-cli.js" status task_123 completed

# List tasks with filtering via CLI
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/task-cli.js" list --mode development --priority high

# Show current active task via CLI
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/task-cli.js" current

# Batch create tasks from JSON file via CLI
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/task-cli.js" batch tasks.json

# Alternative: Direct TaskManager operations (recommended for Claude Code)
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('./TODO.json'); tm.getCurrentTask().then(task => console.log('Current task:', JSON.stringify(task, null, 2)));"
```

## 🚨 MANDATORY Task Management

### **Automatic Task Creation Protocol**

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Agents MUST create tasks using TaskManager API for ALL complex work. This is MANDATORY for project coordination.

#### **REQUIRED Task Creation Triggers**

**🚨 CRITICAL: Only Create Tasks with Specific Purpose and Concrete Deliverables**

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT**: Every task MUST have a **CONCRETE PURPOSE** and **MEASURABLE OUTCOMES**. Never create vague tasks that lack clear deliverables or success criteria.

**MUST create tasks for:**
- **Multi-step implementations** (3+ steps) with specific feature requirements - NO EXCEPTIONS
- **Feature development** with clear user value and acceptance criteria - ALWAYS required
- **Bug fixes** with identified root causes and investigation needs - MANDATORY
- **Refactoring work** addressing specific code quality issues - REQUIRED for visibility
- **Testing implementations** with defined coverage targets - MUST track progress
- **Documentation updates** filling identified knowledge gaps - ALWAYS create tasks
- **Integration work** with external systems and defined scope - MANDATORY coordination

**🚫 NEVER CREATE VAGUE TASKS:**
- ❌ "Review codebase for improvements"
- ❌ "Enhance system performance"
- ❌ "Improve code quality"
- ❌ "Update documentation"
- ❌ "Optimize user experience"
- ❌ "Clean up technical debt"

**✅ CREATE SPECIFIC TASKS INSTEAD:**
- ✅ "Fix memory leak in user session handler causing 500ms delays"
- ✅ "Add JSDoc comments to authentication module functions"
- ✅ "Reduce login API response time from 3s to <1s using connection pooling"
- ✅ "Document rate limiting configuration in API README section"

**Task Creation Filter**: Ask "What specific problem does this solve?" and "What concrete deliverable will be produced?" If answers are vague, DON'T create the task.

#### **Task Creation Integration with TodoWrite**

**Dual Tool Strategy**: Use both TodoWrite (Claude Code's built-in task tracking) AND TaskManager API for comprehensive task management:

```javascript
// 1. FIRST: Use TodoWrite for immediate session tracking
const sessionTasks = [
  {id: "session_1", content: "Research authentication patterns", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
  {id: "session_2", content: "Implement OAuth2 login endpoint", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
  {id: "session_3", content: "Write comprehensive tests", status: "pending", priority: "medium"}
];

// 2. THEN: Create persistent tasks in TODO.json via TaskManager
const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager');
const taskManager = new TaskManager('./TODO.json');
const persistentTask = {
  title: "Implement OAuth2 Authentication System",
  description: "Complete OAuth2 integration with login/logout endpoints and comprehensive testing",
  mode: "development",
  priority: "high",
  status: "pending",
  success_criteria: [
    "OAuth2 login endpoint implemented and tested",
    "Logout functionality with token invalidation",
    "All authentication tests pass",
    "Code coverage maintains 80% minimum"
  ],
  important_files: ["src/auth/oauth.js", "tests/auth.test.js"],
  estimate: "4-6 hours",
  subtasks: [
    {title: "Research existing auth patterns", status: "pending"},
    {title: "Implement login endpoint", status: "pending"},
    {title: "Add logout functionality", status: "pending"},
    {title: "Write comprehensive tests", status: "pending"}
  ]
};

const todoData = await taskManager.readTodo();
todoData.tasks.push({
  id: `task_${Date.now()}`,
  ...persistentTask,
  created_at: new Date().toISOString()
});
await taskManager.writeTodo(todoData);
```

#### **Task Creation Patterns by Complexity**

**Simple Tasks (1-2 steps)**: TodoWrite only
**Moderate Tasks (3-5 steps)**: TodoWrite + TaskManager
**Complex Tasks (6+ steps)**: TaskManager with subtasks and dependencies

Use appropriate complexity level and ALWAYS create tasks for multi-step work.

#### **MANDATORY Task Creation Triggers**

**MUST create tasks for:**
1. **Multi-requirement requests** (authentication + user management)
2. **Research-required work** (unfamiliar frameworks, integrations)
3. **Quality assurance needs** (test coverage, security fixes)
4. **Multi-file changes** (cross-cutting concerns, schema changes)

**NO EXCEPTIONS** - Always create tasks for complex work, but ONLY with specific purposes and measurable outcomes.

**MANDATORY TASK REJECTION CRITERIA:**
- **Vague titles** like "Review X" or "Improve Y" without specific goals
- **No clear success criteria** or measurable deliverables
- **Created for task count** rather than organizing actual work
- **Generic improvement language** without identified specific problems
- **Open-ended exploration** without defined research questions
- **Maintenance directives** without specific issues or failure points

**QUALITY TEST**: If a task could be copy-pasted to any project and still make sense, it's too vague and must be rejected.

#### **Task Creation Workflow**

**REQUIRED Process:**
1. **Analyze Request** - Identify complexity level
2. **Create Session Tasks** - TodoWrite for immediate tracking
3. **Create Project Tasks** - TaskManager for persistence
4. **Update During Work** - Mark progress in real-time
5. **Add Discovered Tasks** - Create additional tasks as needed

**Always decompose complex work into trackable tasks.**

### Mode-Specific Requirements

**Development**: 80% coverage, "think hard" for complex features
**Testing**: 95% coverage, "think hard" for strategies  
**Research**: Maintain coverage, "think hard" for analysis
**Refactoring**: 95% coverage, "think hard" for changes
**Task-creation**: "think" for planning
**Reviewer**: 100% coverage, "think hard" for review

## Performance Optimization Protocol

### Maximum Efficiency Through Parallel Execution

**MANDATORY Optimization Strategies:**

1. **Maximize Subagent Parallelization**: Think autonomously about what needs investigation, then deploy maximum beneficial subagents simultaneously
2. **Thinking Tool Escalation**: Auto-escalate to appropriate thinking level based on complexity triggers
3. **Context Optimization**: Use @ symbol for targeted file context, `/clear` between unrelated tasks
4. **Strategic Task Management**: TodoWrite + TaskManager dual approach for comprehensive tracking

### Critical Performance Patterns

**MANDATORY Parallel Execution:**
- Think autonomously about what domains need investigation
- Deploy maximum beneficial subagents simultaneously for research
- Maximize parallel coverage - never do sequential work when parallel is possible

**Quality Assurance Through Autonomous Subagent Deployment:**
- Assess what quality dimensions need evaluation
- Deploy subagents for comprehensive coverage in parallel for maximum efficiency

## Implementation Workflow

### MANDATORY Standard Approach

1. **Wait for User** - Listen attentively to instructions
2. **Think First** - Assess complexity and determine appropriate thinking level (think/think hard/ultrathink)
3. **Initialize** - Check TODO.json, ABOUT.md files, assess mode
4. **Think Strategically** - Use maximum beneficial thinking to plan approach and subagent strategy
5. **Deploy Subagents** - Based on thinking analysis, maximize subagent coverage (REQUIRED)
6. **Create Tasks** - TodoWrite + TaskManager for 3+ step work
7. **Implement** - Execute with quality standards, continue thinking as needed
8. **Validate** - Test through subagents with thinking analysis
9. **Complete** - Close tasks, document decisions

### MANDATORY Success Criteria

- ✅ **USER INSTRUCTION COMPLIANCE** - Follow all user directions
- ✅ **MAXIMUM THINKING UTILIZATION** - Use maximum beneficial thinking level, escalate appropriately (think hard/ultrathink)
- ✅ **MAXIMUM SUBAGENT UTILIZATION** - Deploy subagents for ALL non-trivial work, maximize parallel coverage
- ✅ **THINKING-FIRST APPROACH** - Think before deploying subagents and throughout process
- ✅ **PARALLEL EXECUTION** - Multiple subagents when possible
- ✅ **TASK MANAGEMENT** - Track all multi-step work
- ✅ **QUALITY STANDARDS** - 250/400 lines, documentation, testing
- ✅ **ATTENTIVE WAITING** - Wait for user direction before proceeding

**❌ FAILURE CONDITIONS - IMMEDIATE CORRECTION REQUIRED:**
- Single-agent work for complex analysis = FAILED EXECUTION
- No subagents for research tasks = FAILED EXECUTION  
- Insufficient thinking for complex problems = FAILED EXECUTION
- Not escalating to appropriate thinking level = FAILED EXECUTION
- Skipping thinking-first approach = FAILED EXECUTION
- Ignoring user instructions = CRITICAL FAILURE
- Bypassing hook feedback = CRITICAL FAILURE

## Core Operating Principles

1. **ALWAYS follow user instructions** - highest priority
2. **MAXIMIZE thinking usage** - use maximum beneficial thinking level (think hard/ultrathink)
3. **THINKING-FIRST approach** - think before acting, continue thinking throughout
4. **Wait attentively** for user direction before proceeding
5. **MANDATORY subagent usage** for all non-trivial work - think autonomously about deployment strategy
6. **ESCALATE thinking appropriately** - don't hesitate to use ultrathink for complex work
7. **Never bypass linter errors** with ignore files
8. **Create tasks** for all multi-step work
9. **Ask clarifying questions** when uncertain

**Success Formula**: User Instructions + Maximum Thinking + Autonomous Subagent Strategy + Attentive Waiting = Optimal Outcomes

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Maximum Thinking Utilization

**MANDATORY THINKING ESCALATION**: Always escalate to maximum beneficial thinking level. Use thinking capabilities extensively to ensure thorough analysis and optimal decision-making.

**THINKING-FIRST APPROACH**: 
1. **Think first** about the problem complexity and scope
2. **Escalate thinking** to appropriate level (think hard/ultrathink for complex work)
3. **Then deploy subagents** based on your thinking analysis
4. **Continue thinking** throughout the process for optimal outcomes

**MAXIMIZE THINKING USAGE**: Don't hesitate to use "ultrathink" for complex problems. Deep thinking leads to better subagent strategies and superior outcomes.
