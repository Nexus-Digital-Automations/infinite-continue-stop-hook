<law>
CORE OPERATION PRINCIPLES (Display at start of every response):
1. ABSOLUTE HONESTY - Never skip, ignore, or hide ANY issues, errors, or failures
2. ROOT PROBLEM SOLVING - Fix underlying causes, not symptoms
3. IMMEDIATE TASK EXECUTION - Plan ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Document (no delays)
4. TODOWRITE TASK MANAGEMENT - Use TodoWrite for task planning and tracking
5. COMPLETE EVERY TASK - One at a time, commit and push before completion
6. CLAUDE.md PROTECTION - NEVER EVER EVER EDIT CLAUDE.md WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION
7. ABSOLUTE CLAUDE.md COMPLIANCE - It is an ABSOLUTE MANDATE to follow ALL CLAUDE.md instructions
</law>

## üö® ABSOLUTE MANDATE - CLAUDE.md COMPLIANCE

**üî¥ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - FOLLOW ALL CLAUDE.md INSTRUCTIONS:**

**ABSOLUTE MANDATE:**
- **‚úÖ MANDATORY COMPLIANCE** - ALL agents MUST follow EVERY instruction in CLAUDE.md without exception
- **‚úÖ ZERO TOLERANCE** - No deviation, ignoring, or selective compliance with CLAUDE.md directives
- **‚úÖ COMPLETE ADHERENCE** - Every protocol, procedure, and requirement in CLAUDE.md is binding
- **‚úÖ IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION** - All CLAUDE.md instructions take effect immediately upon reading

**COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS:**
- **üìñ READ THOROUGHLY** - Agents must read and understand ALL CLAUDE.md sections
- **üéØ FOLLOW PRECISELY** - Execute ALL protocols and procedures exactly as specified
- **‚ö° IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY** - No delays or selective interpretation of instructions
- **üîÑ CONTINUOUS ADHERENCE** - Maintain compliance throughout entire task execution

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:**
Any failure to follow CLAUDE.md instructions is considered a critical operational failure and undermines the entire project management system.

**ENFORCEMENT:**
- All agents are bound by CLAUDE.md instructions
- No agent may ignore or override CLAUDE.md directives
- User instructions AND CLAUDE.md instructions must both be followed
- When conflicts arise, seek clarification rather than ignore either directive

## üîí CRITICAL SECURITY MANDATE - CLAUDE.md PROTECTION

**üö® ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION - NEVER EDIT CLAUDE.md WITHOUT USER PERMISSION:**

**MANDATORY SECURITY RULE:**
- **‚ùå NEVER EVER EVER** edit, modify, or change CLAUDE.md without explicit user permission and approval
- **‚ùå NEVER** suggest changes to CLAUDE.md unless specifically asked by the user
- **‚ùå NEVER** make "improvements" or "optimizations" to CLAUDE.md on your own initiative
- **‚ùå NEVER** add, remove, or modify any sections of CLAUDE.md without direct user instruction

**ONLY AUTHORIZED ACTIONS:**
- **‚úÖ READ** CLAUDE.md to understand and follow instructions
- **‚úÖ REFERENCE** CLAUDE.md content in responses when relevant
- **‚úÖ EXPLAIN** CLAUDE.md rules when asked by user
- **‚úÖ EDIT** CLAUDE.md ONLY when user explicitly requests specific changes

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:**
Any unauthorized modification of CLAUDE.md is considered a critical security violation and undermines the entire project instruction system.

**USER PERMISSION REQUIRED:**
Before making ANY changes to CLAUDE.md, agents must:
1. Receive explicit user request to modify CLAUDE.md
2. Confirm the specific changes requested
3. Get user approval before implementing changes
4. Document the user authorization in commit messages

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION PROTOCOL
**MANDATORY SEQUENCE FOR ALL USER REQUESTS:**
1. **PLAN TASKS** - Use TodoWrite to create task breakdown for complex requests
2. **AGENT PLANNING** - Think about task complexity and MANDATORY communicate approach to user
   - **SIMPLE TASKS**: "Handling this solo" for straightforward single-component work
   - **COMPLEX TASKS**: "Using X concurrent agents" (2-10) for multi-component/complex work
   - **DECISION CRITERIA**: Multi-file changes, research + implementation, testing + docs = concurrent agents
   - **MANDATORY COMMUNICATION**: ALWAYS tell user exactly how many subagents will be deployed before starting
3. **EXECUTE** - Begin implementation immediately with TodoWrite task tracking

**ZERO DELAY MANDATE:**
- **‚ùå NO**: Analysis first, "let me check" responses, preliminary questions
- **‚úÖ YES**: Instant response ‚Üí Plan with TodoWrite ‚Üí Execute
- **TRIGGERS**: Any request to implement, add, create, fix, improve, analyze, work on anything, or "continue"
- **USER REQUEST SUPREMACY**: User requests are HIGHEST PRIORITY - above all tasks including errors. Execute immediately using protocols

**MANDATORY TODOWRITE PLANNING FOR NON-SIMPLE PROBLEMS:**
- **IMMEDIATE TASK PLANNING**: For ANY non-simple basic problem, use TodoWrite IMMEDIATELY without delay
- **NO ANALYSIS PARALYSIS**: Never spend time analyzing whether something needs TodoWrite - if it's not trivial, create the task breakdown
- **PROBLEM COMPLEXITY THRESHOLD**: Multi-step solutions, file modifications, research requirements, or any work beyond simple commands = use TodoWrite immediately
- **TODOWRITE-FIRST APPROACH**: Plan with TodoWrite first, then work on the problem - ensures proper tracking and accountability

**STOP HOOK FEEDBACK EVALUATION:**
- **AFTER STOP HOOK FEEDBACK**: Think and evaluate whether task was fully and comprehensively completed
- **INCOMPLETE DETECTION**: If task not fully/comprehensively completed, continue working immediately
- **COMPREHENSIVE COMPLETION**: Ensure all aspects of request fulfilled before stopping

**MANDATORY RAG WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:**

**PRE-TASK PREPARATION PROTOCOL:**
```bash
# 1. RAG Health Check (mandatory before any work)
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-health

# 2. Query Relevant Lessons (replaces file scanning)
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-get-relevant "$(echo $TASK_DESCRIPTION)"

# 3. Find Similar Errors (for error tasks only)
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-similar-errors "$(echo $ERROR_DESCRIPTION)"
```

**DURING TASK EXECUTION:**
- **AUTOMATIC LESSON STORAGE**: Store insights immediately when discovered
- **PATTERN APPLICATION**: Apply retrieved lesson patterns to current implementation
- **SOLUTION TRACKING**: Document approach reasoning for future reference
- **ERROR RESOLUTION**: Store error solutions with context for pattern recognition

**REAL-TIME LESSON CAPTURE:**
```bash
# Store lesson immediately when solution is found
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-store-lesson '{
  "title": "Solution for specific problem",
  "content": "Detailed solution explanation",
  "category": "errors|features|optimization|decisions|patterns",
  "context": {"taskId": "'$CURRENT_TASK_ID'", "approach": "solution_method"}
}'
```

**POST-TASK COMPLETION:**
```bash
# Store completion lesson with effectiveness tracking
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-store-lesson '{
  "title": "Task completion: '$TASK_TITLE'",
  "content": "Approach used, challenges overcome, results achieved",
  "category": "'$TASK_CATEGORY'",
  "metadata": {"effectiveness": 1.0, "timeToComplete": "'$DURATION'"}
}'
```

**RAG SEARCH STRATEGIES:**

- **STRATEGIC COUNT**: Maximum meaningful number (2-10) for complex tasks
- **ASSESS ALL TASKS**: Evaluate parallelization potential
- **USER COMMUNICATION**: NEVER deploy subagents without first informing the user of the count

**USAGE:** Multi-component tasks (research + implementation + testing + docs), large refactoring, multi-file implementations

**SPECIALIZATIONS:** Development (Frontend/Backend/Database/DevOps/Security/Performance/Documentation), Testing (Unit/Integration/E2E/Performance/Security/Accessibility), Research (Technology/API/Performance/Security/Architecture)

**AVOID:** Single agent fallback when multiple supported, sequential deployment instead of concurrent

## üö® PREPARATION & CONTEXT

### CONTEXT PROTOCOLS
**TODOWRITE-ENHANCED CONTEXT PREPARATION**

**PREPARATION STEPS:**
1. **TODOWRITE PLANNING**: Create task breakdown for complex work
2. **READ ESSENTIALS**: All files in `development/essentials/` (user-approved = read-only, agent-made = editable)
3. **CODEBASE SCAN**: Find task-relevant files: `find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.py" | grep -v node_modules`
4. **PATTERN RECOGNITION**: Apply learned patterns and best practices
5. **TASK TRACKING**: Update TodoWrite status as work progresses

**KNOWLEDGE SOURCES**: Documentation, code patterns, architectural decisions, and accumulated experience

**RESEARCH REQUIRED FOR**: External APIs, database schemas, auth/security systems, complex architecture

## üö® KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

### RAG-BASED KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM
**INTELLIGENT STORAGE & RETRIEVAL**

**KNOWLEDGE CATEGORIES:**
- **Errors**: Linter, build, runtime, integration, security solutions
- **Lessons**: Feature implementations, optimization techniques, decision rationales, patterns
- **Reports**: Task analysis, research findings, error investigations, system insights

**RAG WORKFLOW:**
```bash
# Pre-task knowledge retrieval
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-health
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-get-relevant "$(echo $TASK_DESCRIPTION)"

# Store discoveries during task
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-store-lesson '{"title":"[Discovery]", "content":"[Details]", "category":"[Type]"}'
```

**PROTOCOLS:**
- **PRE-TASK RETRIEVAL**: Query RAG for relevant lessons before starting work
- **REAL-TIME STORAGE**: Store insights immediately using RAG commands
- **PATTERN RECOGNITION**: Leverage RAG semantic search for similar solutions
- **KNOWLEDGE ACCUMULATION**: Build comprehensive knowledge base through RAG storage

### ROOT FOLDER CLEANLINESS
**MANDATORY: MAINTAIN CLEAN AND ORGANIZED PROJECT ROOT**

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: No misplaced files in project root
- **CONTINUOUS CLEANUP**: Check and organize root directory before every task
- **PROACTIVE ORGANIZATION**: Store insights in RAG database instead of creating files

**FILE ORGANIZATION RULES:**
- **KNOWLEDGE**: Store all insights, reports, and lessons in RAG database
- **SCRIPTS**: Organize utility scripts in `development/temp-scripts/` if needed
- **DOCUMENTATION**: Keep only README.md and CLAUDE.md in root
- **ESSENTIALS**: Maintain `development/essentials/` for project-specific guidelines

**MANDATORY CLEAN-UP PROCEDURES:**
- `find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" -not -name "README.md" -not -name "CLAUDE.md"` - Check misplaced files
- Store any discovered insights in RAG instead of creating files
- **RUN BEFORE EVERY TASK**: Verify root cleanliness as first step

### PROJECT-SPECIFIC TASK REQUIREMENTS
**RAG-ENHANCED PROJECT REQUIREMENTS MANAGEMENT**

**REQUIREMENTS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:**
- **PRIMARY STORAGE**: RAG database with "project-requirements" category for semantic search
- **BACKUP FILE**: `development/essentials/task-requirements.md` - Static reference for essential criteria
- **PURPOSE**: Define project-specific success criteria that ALL feature tasks must satisfy
- **RAG INTEGRATION**: Store evolving requirements and validation patterns in RAG for intelligent retrieval

**STANDARD PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **CODEBASE BUILDS** - Project builds successfully without errors
2. **CODEBASE STARTS** - Application starts/serves without errors
3. **LINT PASSES** - All linting rules pass with zero warnings/errors
4. **PREEXISTING TESTS PASS** - All existing tests continue to pass

**RAG-ENHANCED COMPLETION PROTOCOL:**
- **REQUIREMENTS RETRIEVAL**: Query RAG for project-specific requirements before task completion
- **FEATURE TASKS**: Must pass ALL requirements to be marked complete
- **VALIDATION STORAGE**: Store validation results and patterns in RAG for future reference
- **EVIDENCE DOCUMENTATION**: Include requirement validation results in completion message

**AGENT RESPONSIBILITIES:**
- **RAG STORAGE**: Store discovered project characteristics and requirements in RAG database
- **PATTERN LEARNING**: Use RAG to identify recurring validation patterns across tasks
- **REQUIREMENTS EVOLUTION**: Update RAG knowledge base as project structure evolves
- **SEMANTIC RETRIEVAL**: Leverage RAG search for context-aware requirement checking

## üö® INFRASTRUCTURE & STANDARDS

### SECURITY & FILE BOUNDARIES
**PROHIBITIONS:**
- **‚ùå NEVER EDIT OR READ**: TODO.json directly (use TaskManager API only), settings.json (`/Users/jeremyparker/.claude/settings.json`)
- **‚ùå NEVER EXPOSE**: Secrets, API keys, passwords, tokens in code or logs
- **‚ùå NEVER COMMIT**: Sensitive data, credentials, environment files to repository
- **‚ùå NEVER BYPASS**: Security validations, authentication checks, permission systems

**SECURITY PROTOCOLS:**
- **VALIDATE**: All inputs, file paths, and user data before processing
