## ‚ùì Potential Features Awaiting User Verification

*This section is for Claude Code agents to propose new features for user review and approval.*

### Instructions for Agents:
1. **Before adding features here**: Always read this file first to avoid duplicating existing features
2. **Feature format**: Use clear titles, descriptions, and rationale
3. **User approval required**: Features in this section require explicit user approval before moving to "Planned Features"
4. **Implementation**: Only implement features that have been approved and moved to "Planned Features"

### Proposed Features:

#### User Management System
**Description**: Comprehensive user management functionality including user profiles, authentication, authorization, and user data management integrated with existing OAuth 2.0 system
**Rationale**: The OAuth 2.0 authentication system is already implemented (as evidenced in research-report-task_1755639998690_g7jzz80wu.md) but lacks the user management layer needed for a complete authentication system. User management is essential for any application requiring user accounts, profiles, and access control.
**Implementation Effort**: Medium - builds on existing OAuth infrastructure
**Dependencies**: OAuth 2.0 authentication system (already implemented), database schema design
**Proposed by**: development_session_1756276145521_1_general_dece607d on 2025-08-27

```markdown
#### Feature Name
**Description**: Brief description of the feature
**Rationale**: Why this feature would be beneficial
**Implementation Effort**: Estimated complexity (Low/Medium/High)
**Dependencies**: Any required dependencies or prerequisites
**Proposed by**: Agent ID and date
```

## üîß Feature Implementation Workflow

### For Claude Code Agents:

1. **Feature Discovery Phase**:
   - **MANDATORY**: Always read this features.md file before starting any work
   - Check if the feature already exists in any section
   - Review TODO.json for related implementation tasks

2. **Feature Proposal Process**:
   - If you identify a beneficial feature not listed above
   - Add it to "‚ùì Potential Features Awaiting User Verification" section
   - Use the specified format with clear description and rationale
   - Do NOT implement proposed features without user approval

3. **Feature Implementation Process**:
   - Only implement features from "üìã Planned Features" section
   - Move implemented features to "‚úÖ Implemented Features" when complete
   - Update implementation status and provide completion details

### For Users:

1. **Feature Review Process**:
   - Review "‚ùì Potential Features Awaiting User Verification" section regularly
   - Approve valuable features by moving them to "üìã Planned Features"
   - Remove or modify features that don't align with project goals

2. **Feature Planning**:
   - Prioritize features in "üìã Planned Features" section
   - Add specific implementation requirements or constraints
   - Create corresponding tasks in TODO.json when ready for implementation
