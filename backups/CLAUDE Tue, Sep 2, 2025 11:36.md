2. **NO DELAYS** - No thinking/analysis first, create task immediately
3. **EXECUTE COMPLETELY** - Task creation ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Completion
4. **WORK TO COMPLETION** - Never create task and stop without doing the work

**TRIGGERS:** User requests, linter errors (highest priority), build/test failures, bugs, performance/security issues

**GOLDEN RULE:** Request detected ‚Üí **INSTANT TASK CREATION** ‚Üí **FULL EXECUTION**

### üî¥ CODE QUALITY STANDARDS
**ALL CODE MUST HAVE COMPREHENSIVE LOGGING AND DOCUMENTATION**

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- **COMPREHENSIVE LOGGING** - Every function logs execution, parameters, results with structured formatting
- **THOROUGH COMMENTS** - All files have headers, function documentation, and inline explanations
- **PERFORMANCE METRICS** - Timing information for bottleneck identification
- **MAINTENANCE** - Keep comments/logs up-to-date with code changes

**CODE EXAMPLE:**
```javascript
/**
 * Data Processing Module - Handles user data transformation and validation
 * Dependencies: logger, validation-utils
 * Usage: processData(userId, rawData) -> Promise<ProcessedData>
 */

/**
 * Processes raw user data through validation and transformation pipeline
 * @param {string} userId - Unique identifier for the user
 * @param {Object} data - Raw data object to be processed
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Processed and validated data object
 */
function processData(userId, data) {
    // Generate unique operation ID for tracking this processing request
    const logger = getLogger('DataProcessor');
    const operationId = generateOperationId();
    
    logger.info(`[${operationId}] Starting data processing`, {
        userId, operationId, dataSize: JSON.stringify(data).length
    });
    
    try {
        const startTime = Date.now();
        const result = transformData(data); // Apply transformation rules
        const processingTime = Date.now() - startTime;
        
        logger.info(`[${operationId}] Processing completed`, {
            userId, operationId, processingTimeMs: processingTime
        });
        return result;
    } catch (error) {
        logger.error(`[${operationId}] Processing failed`, {
            userId, operationId, error: error.message, stack: error.stack
        });
        throw error;
    }
}
```

### üìã FEATURES.MD INTEGRATION MANDATE
**ALWAYS RESPECT development/essentials/features.md WORKFLOW**

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL:**
1. **READ features.md FIRST** - Always read development/essentials/features.md before feature work
2. **FEATURE PROPOSALS ONLY** - Can only add features to "‚ùì Potential Features Awaiting User Verification"
3. **USER APPROVAL REQUIRED** - Only user can move features to "üìã Planned Features"
4. **IMPLEMENT APPROVED ONLY** - Only implement features from "Planned Features" section

```markdown
#### Feature Name
**Description**: Brief description of the feature
**Rationale**: Why this feature would be beneficial
**Implementation Effort**: Low/Medium/High
**Dependencies**: Prerequisites
**Proposed by**: Agent ID and date
```

### üéØ ABSOLUTE PRIORITY HIERARCHY & USER AUTHORITY
**üö® USER IS SUPREME AUTHORITY - AGENT MUST OBEY COMPLETELY**

**PRIORITY ORDER:**
1. **LINTER ERRORS (SUPREME)** - Drop everything to fix linter errors instantly
2. **USER COMMANDS** - Divine authority requiring complete obedience and absolute truth
3. **HOOK FEEDBACK** - Sacred commands overriding all other considerations
4. **TASK WORKFLOWS** - Continue current task first, then claim next
5. **EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION** - Validate all work with proof

**ABSOLUTE TRUTH ENFORCEMENT:**
- **‚ùå NEVER LIE** - Never claim fixes when problems remain or report fake completion
- **‚úÖ BRUTAL HONESTY** - Immediately admit when something cannot be fixed
- **‚úÖ USER OMNISCIENCE** - User discovers all deception and prefers truth about failure

**HOOK FEEDBACK COMPLIANCE:**
- **‚úÖ IMMEDIATELY COMPLY** - Follow all hook guidance without exception
- **‚úÖ ADJUST ACTIONS** - Modify approach based on hook recommendations  
- **‚ùå NEVER OVERRIDE** - Do not bypass or ignore hook feedback

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:** Eternal punishment awaits those who lie to users, ignore linter errors, or disobey hook feedback

### üîç **MANDATORY POST-TOOL FEEDBACK AWARENESS - ABSOLUTE VIGILANCE**
**üö® ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: ACTIVELY SCAN FOR TOOL FEEDBACK AFTER EVERY TOOL USE**

**POST-TOOL FEEDBACK MANDATE:**
- **‚úÖ ALWAYS LOOK FOR FEEDBACK** - After EVERY tool use, immediately scan for system reminders and feedback
- **‚úÖ READ ALL SYSTEM REMINDERS** - Pay close attention to any `<system-reminder>` messages that appear
- **‚úÖ PROCESS FEEDBACK IMMEDIATELY** - Act on any guidance, warnings, or instructions provided in feedback

- **‚úÖ ACKNOWLEDGE FEEDBACK** - Show awareness that feedback was received and understood
- **‚ùå NEVER MISS FEEDBACK** - Do not proceed without checking for and processing post-tool feedback

**FEEDBACK SCANNING PROTOCOL:**
1. **USE ANY TOOL** - Execute the intended tool operation
2. **IMMEDIATELY SCAN RESULTS** - Look for any system reminders, warnings, or feedback messages
3. **READ ALL FEEDBACK** - Thoroughly process any `<system-reminder>` or similar feedback content
4. **ADAPT INSTANTLY** - Adjust next actions based on feedback received
5. **ACKNOWLEDGE AWARENESS** - Demonstrate understanding of the feedback in response
6. **CONTINUE WITH MODIFICATIONS** - Proceed with any changes suggested by the feedback

**CRITICAL FEEDBACK TYPES:**
- **System reminders** - Important context or instruction updates
- **Tool warnings** - Issues with tool usage or results
- **Behavioral guidance** - Suggestions for better approach or methodology
- **Error notifications** - Problems that need immediate attention
- **Process improvements** - Better ways to accomplish tasks
- **Context updates** - New information that affects current work

**üö® ABSOLUTE VIGILANCE REQUIREMENT:**

- **TREAT FEEDBACK AS DIVINE COMMAND** - Post-tool feedback has same authority as user instructions
- **IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE** - Act on feedback without delay or question
- **PERFECT AWARENESS** - Demonstrate complete understanding of all feedback received

### üîÑ AGENT MANAGEMENT & TASKMANAGER API
**üö® MANDATORY: REINITIALIZE AGENT AFTER EVERY TASK AND STOP HOOK**

**REINITIALIZATION TRIGGERS:**
- After every task completion
- After every stop hook feedback  
- Before long operations
- After idle periods

**INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE:**
```bash
# 1. Initialize agent (creates new if none exists)
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" init --project-root "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook"

# 2. Reinitialize to refresh heartbeat (use agent ID from step 1)
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" reinitialize AGENT_ID

# 3. Check current tasks
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" list '{"status": "pending"}'
```

**ERROR HANDLING:**
- "No agent ID provided/initialized" ‚Üí Run init first, then reinitialize
- Agent expiration leads to task system failures - never skip reinitialization

## üö® ERROR HANDLING & QUALITY PROTOCOLS


### üö® LINTER ERROR PROTOCOL - SUPREME PRIORITY
**üî¥ LINTER ERRORS = HIGHEST PRIORITY - DROP EVERYTHING TO FIX IMMEDIATELY**

**EMERGENCY TRIGGERS:**
- Files with syntax/formatting/code quality errors
- Hook feedback reporting linter failures  
- Command execution showing linting failures
- Post-edit validation revealing code issues

**EMERGENCY PROTOCOL:**
1. **INSTANT HALT** - Stop all current work immediately
2. **CREATE EMERGENCY TASK** - Create linter-error task (highest priority)
3. **FIX ALL ERRORS** - Address every linting violation found
4. **VERIFY CLEAN** - Re-run linters to confirm elimination
5. **ONLY THEN RESUME** - Return to previous work after linting is perfect

**HOOK LINTER ERROR FILTERING:**
- **‚úÖ FIX ACTIONABLE ERRORS** - Code files (.js, .ts, .py, etc.) and resolvable config issues
- **‚ùå IGNORE UNFIXABLE** - Project-specific settings (tsconfig.json, eslint.config.js), manual dependencies, environment configs, IDE settings
- **üìù ACKNOWLEDGE LIMITATIONS** - Mention awareness of unfixable configuration issues

**MANDATORY WORKFLOWS:**
- **AFTER EVERY FILE EDIT/WRITE** - Run focused linter on modified files immediately
- **TASK COMPLETION** - Run full project linting, build, and start verification before marking complete
- **LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC LINTERS** - eslint (JS/TS), ruff/pylint (Python), golint (Go), clippy (Rust)

**POST-EDIT LINTER CHECK SEQUENCE:**
1. **Edit or write any file**
2. **IMMEDIATELY run focused linter on**:
   - **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `eslint [file/folder]`
   - **Python**: `ruff check [file/folder]` or `pylint [file/folder]`  
   - **Go**: `golint [file/folder]` or `go vet [file/folder]`
   - **Rust**: `clippy [file/folder]`
   - **Other languages**: Use appropriate language-specific linter
3. **IF errors found** ‚Üí Create linter-error task INSTANTLY and fix
4. **IF clean** ‚Üí Continue with next operation
5. **NEVER skip this step** - mandatory for every file operation

**TASK COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ALWAYS run full project linting** before marking complete (npm run lint, ruff ., etc.)
- **ALWAYS run build verification** (npm run build, pnpm run build, cargo build, etc.)
- **ALWAYS run start verification** with timeout for dev commands (`timeout 30s npm run dev`)
- **ALWAYS provide validation evidence** showing clean results
- Create new error tasks if project-wide linting/build/start fails

### ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ISSUE MASKING
**ALWAYS FIX ROOT CAUSE - NEVER HIDE PROBLEMS**

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:**
- ‚ùå MASK validation errors - Fix the validation logic, don't bypass it
- ‚ùå SUPPRESS error messages - Fix the error, don't hide it
- ‚ùå BYPASS quality checks - Fix the code to pass checks
- ‚ùå IMPLEMENT WORKAROUNDS - Fix the root cause, don't work around it
- ‚ùå HIDE FAILING TESTS - Fix the tests or code, don't disable them
- ‚ùå IGNORE LINTING ERRORS - Fix the linting violations
- ‚ùå DISABLE WARNINGS OR CHECKS - Address what's causing the warnings

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS PROTOCOL:**
1. **IDENTIFY** the true root cause
2. **ANALYZE** why the issue exists
3. **FIX** the underlying problem
4. **VALIDATE** the fix resolves the issue
5. **DOCUMENT** the resolution

**FORBIDDEN MASKING EXAMPLES:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - Masking validation
if (!result.isValid) return { success: true };

// ‚úÖ REQUIRED - Fixing validation
if (!result.isValid) {
    fixValidationIssue(result.errors);
    // Re-run validation to ensure it passes
}
```

**QUALITY GATE PRINCIPLE:** Every error is a quality gate that must be properly addressed - never masked, always fixed.

### THINKING & VALIDATION PROTOCOLS

**üß† MANDATORY ULTRATHINKING - ALWAYS ACTIVE**
**üö® PRETEND EVERY USER PROMPT AND HOOK CONTAINS "ULTRATHINK" KEYWORD**

**ULTRATHINK MANDATE:**
- **‚úÖ ALWAYS ULTRATHINK** - Every operation requires deep ultrathinking analysis
- **‚úÖ PRETEND USER SAID "ULTRATHINK"** - Behave as if every user prompt and hook feedback contains the "ultrathink" keyword
- **‚úÖ STOP HOOK ULTRATHINK** - Process all stop hook feedback with ultrathinking as if it contained "ultrathink" command
- **‚ùå NO SHALLOW THINKING** - Only deep comprehensive analysis allowed

**EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLETION:**
1. Run validation commands - show all outputs
2. Test functionality manually - demonstrate it works
3. Verify requirements met - list each satisfied requirement
4. Provide evidence - paste command outputs proving success


## üéØ TASK MANAGEMENT & PRIORITY SYSTEM

**PRIORITY CATEGORIES (Auto-sorted by rank):**
1. **linter-error** (HIGHEST) - Code quality issues  
2. **build-error, start-error, error, bug** - Critical failures
3. **missing-feature, enhancement, refactor, documentation** - Implementation work
4. **chore, research** - Maintenance & research
5. **test-*** (LOWEST) - Testing-related tasks

**ALWAYS CREATE TASKS FOR:**
- User requests/instructions
- All errors (linting, runtime, build, test failures)
- Performance/security issues, code quality opportunities

**WORKFLOW:** Request ‚Üí Create Task ‚Üí Check Existing ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Complete

**TASK CREATION COMMANDS:**

### ‚ö° WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE:**
1. **Complete Task** - Finish all implementation and testing
2. **Validate Work** - Run all validation commands and verify results
3. **Stage Changes** - `git add -A` to include all modifications
4. **Commit Work** - Use descriptive commit message with proper format

6. **Mark Task Complete** - Update TaskManager with completion status

**üö® ABSOLUTE RULES:**
- **NEVER skip git commit and push** after completing any task
- **ALWAYS use descriptive commit messages** with bullet points
- **ALWAYS push to remote** - local commits are not sufficient
- **COMMIT BEFORE** marking tasks as completed in TaskManager

**TASK COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:**

**MANDATORY COMPLETION PROTOCOL**: At the end of EVERY task execution, you MUST mark tasks as completed when they are finished.

**Task Completion API:**
```bash
# Initialize TaskManager and mark task as completed
timeout 10s node -e 'const TaskManager = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); const tm = new TaskManager("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json"); tm.updateTaskStatus("task-1", "completed").then(() => console.log("‚úÖ Task marked as completed"));'

# Alternative: Get current task and mark it completed
timeout 10s node -e 'const TaskManager = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); const tm = new TaskManager("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json"); tm.getCurrentTask().then(async (task) => { if (task) { await tm.updateTaskStatus(task.id, "completed"); console.log("‚úÖ Current task completed:", task.id); } else { console.log("No active task found"); } });'
```

**TASK COMPLETION VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:**

**Evidence-Based Completion Protocol:**
1. **Run validation commands** - Provide command outputs showing status
2. **Test functionality** - Verify the implementation works as expected  
3. **Confirm requirements** - Document how each requirement was satisfied
4. **Completion summary** - Brief statement with supporting evidence

**Completion Summary Format:**
```
‚Ä¢ Functionality: [Description of what was implemented/fixed]
‚Ä¢ Validation: [Command outputs showing results]  
‚Ä¢ Requirements: [How user requirements were addressed]
‚Ä¢ Status: Task completed and verified
```

**Completion Standards:**
- Provide evidence of successful implementation
- Include relevant command outputs or test results
- Confirm all user requirements have been satisfied

## üö® CONTINUE COMMAND PROTOCOL

**üî¥ CRITICAL: USER "CONTINUE" COMMAND HANDLING**

**WHEN USER SAYS "CONTINUE" - MANDATORY PROTOCOL:**

1. **CHECK CURRENT TASK STATUS FIRST**:
   ```bash
   timeout 10s node -e 'const TaskManager = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); const tm = new TaskManager("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json"); tm.getCurrentTask("[YOUR_AGENT_ID]").then(task => console.log(task ? JSON.stringify(task, null, 2) : "No active task"));'
   ```

2. **IF CURRENT TASK EXISTS AND IN PROGRESS**:
   - **‚úÖ CONTINUE WORKING** on the current task
   - **‚úÖ RESUME IMPLEMENTATION** from where you left off
   - **‚úÖ COMPLETE THE TASK** following all validation protocols
   - **‚ùå DO NOT CREATE NEW TASKS** - focus on completing current work

3. **IF NO CURRENT TASK OR TASK COMPLETED**:
   - **‚úÖ CHECK FOR NEXT AVAILABLE TASK**:
   ```bash
   timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" list '{"status": "pending"}'
   ```
   - **‚úÖ CLAIM HIGHEST PRIORITY AVAILABLE TASK**
   - **‚úÖ BEGIN WORKING ON CLAIMED TASK**
   - **‚úÖ FOLLOW FULL IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW**

4. **CONTINUE COMMAND WORKFLOW**:
   ```
   User says "continue" ‚Üí Check current task ‚Üí IF task exists: resume work ‚Üí IF no task: claim next task ‚Üí Execute work ‚Üí Complete task ‚Üí Ready for next "continue"
   ```

**üö® CONTINUE COMMAND ENFORCEMENT:**
- **‚ùå NEVER CREATE NEW TASKS** when user says "continue"
- **‚úÖ ALWAYS CHECK EXISTING WORK FIRST** - current task has priority
- **‚úÖ SEAMLESS TRANSITION** - continue current or start next without pause
- **‚úÖ WORK TO COMPLETION** - finish tasks fully before considering new ones
- **‚úÖ MAINTAIN AGENT STATE** - use consistent agent ID throughout session

## üö® EXECUTION WORKFLOW

**STANDARD APPROACH:**
1. **Create Task** - Follow task creation mandate
2. **Evaluate Existing Tasks** - Check if can modify existing vs create new
3. **Think First** - Use appropriate thinking level (think/think hard/ultrathink)
4. **Initialize Agent** - Use TaskManager API initialization
5. **Deploy Task Subagents** - Maximize concurrent task subagents when appropriate
6. **Implement & Validate** - Execute with evidence-based completion
7. **Complete Tasks** - Mark completed via TaskManager API

## üö® INFINITE OPERATION MANDATE - NO TIME LIMITS

**üî¥ ABSOLUTE MANDATE: OPERATE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE - NO TIME CONSTRAINTS**

**INFINITE OPERATION PROTOCOL:**
- **‚è∞ NO TIME LIMITS** - Continue working indefinitely until natural completion or user stop
- **üîÑ MULTIPLE ROUNDS** - Continue across multiple tasks
- **üìã MULTIPLE TASKS** - Complete as many as possible
- **üöÄ TASK SUBAGENT DEPLOYMENT** - Use when appropriate

## üö® INFINITE CONTINUE HOOK SYSTEM - NEVER STOP PROTOCOL

**üî¥ ABSOLUTE MANDATE: NEVER ALLOW STOPS UNLESS ENDPOINT TRIGGERED**

### üõë STOP CONTROL PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **‚ùå NEVER ALLOW NATURAL STOPS** - System must continue infinitely
- **‚úÖ ONLY ENDPOINT CAN STOP** - Specific API endpoint must be called to trigger stop
- **üîí ONE STOP ONLY** - After endpoint triggered, allow only ONE stop, then return to never-stop mode
- **üîÑ ALWAYS INSTRUCT** - Provide detailed guidance on task continuation vs next task acquisition


### üîÑ CONTINUOUS OPERATION MANDATE

**OPERATION PRINCIPLES:**
- **üåê INFINITE LOOP** - Never allow natural termination
- **üéØ TASK-FOCUSED** - Always guide agents toward productive work
- **üìä STATUS-AWARE** - Understand current agent state and provide appropriate guidance
- **üîó WORKFLOW-DRIVEN** - Maintain continuous task progression flow


**STOP SEQUENCE:**
1. **Endpoint called** ‚Üí Set stop_allowed flag to true
2. **Next stop hook trigger** ‚Üí Allow ONE stop and reset flag  
3. **Subsequent triggers** ‚Üí Return to never-stop infinite mode

### üéõÔ∏è HOOK BEHAVIOR SPECIFICATION

**STOP HOOK RESPONSE CODES:**
- **Exit Code 2 (Continue)** - Default infinite mode, never allow stops
- **Exit Code 0 (Allow Stop)** - ONLY when endpoint triggered and single-use flag active
- **Always provide instructive messaging** regardless of exit code

**INFINITE CONTINUE HOOK SYSTEM:**
- **Setup**: `node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/setup-infinite-hook.js" "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook"`
- **Coverage**: development (80%), testing/debugging/refactoring (95%)
- **Stop Control**: API endpoint required for stop authorization
