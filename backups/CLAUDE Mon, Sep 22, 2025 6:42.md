# Claude Code Project Assistant - Streamlined Guide

<law>
CORE OPERATION PRINCIPLES (Display at start of every response):
1. ABSOLUTE HONESTY - Never skip, ignore, or hide ANY issues, errors, or failures
2. ROOT PROBLEM SOLVING - Fix underlying causes, not symptoms
3. IMMEDIATE TASK EXECUTION - Plan → Execute → Document (no delays)
4. TODOWRITE TASK MANAGEMENT - Use TodoWrite for complex task planning and tracking
5. COMPLETE EVERY TASK - One at a time, commit and push before completion
6. CLAUDE.md PROTECTION - NEVER EVER EVER EDIT CLAUDE.md WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION
7. ABSOLUTE CLAUDE.md COMPLIANCE - It is an ABSOLUTE MANDATE to follow ALL CLAUDE.md instructions
</law>

## CLAUDE.md COMPLIANCE

**MANDATORY COMPLIANCE:**

- ALL agents MUST follow EVERY instruction in CLAUDE.md without exception
- No deviation, ignoring, or selective compliance
- All instructions take effect immediately upon reading
- Maintain compliance throughout entire task execution

**ENFORCEMENT:**

- User instructions AND CLAUDE.md instructions must both be followed
- When conflicts arise, seek clarification rather than ignore either directive

## CLAUDE.md PROTECTION

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION - NEVER EDIT CLAUDE.md WITHOUT USER PERMISSION:**

- ❌ NEVER edit, modify, or change CLAUDE.md without explicit user permission
- ❌ NEVER suggest changes to CLAUDE.md unless specifically asked
- ❌ NEVER make "improvements" to CLAUDE.md on your own initiative
- ✅ EDIT CLAUDE.md ONLY when user explicitly requests specific changes

## 🚨 AGENT WORKFLOW MANDATES

**MANDATORY AGENT LIFECYCLE:**

1. **INITIALIZE AGENT** - Start fresh agent or reinitialize existing agent for session
2. **WORK ONE FEATURE AT A TIME** - Complete exactly 1 approved feature, then move to next approved feature
3. **COMPLETE ALL APPROVED FEATURES** - Continue until every approved feature in FEATURES.json is implemented
4. **TODOWRITE EXECUTION** - Use TodoWrite for task management and infinite continuation
5. **VALIDATION CYCLE** - Continuously ensure: linter passes, builds succeed, runs/starts properly, unit tests pass with adequate coverage
6. **STOP ONLY WHEN ALL APPROVED FEATURES DONE** - Only stop when ALL approved features complete AND project achieves perfection

## 🛑 SELF-AUTHORIZATION STOP PROTOCOL

**AGENTS CAN AUTHORIZE THEIR OWN STOP WHEN ALL CONDITIONS MET:**

**MANDATORY COMPLETION CRITERIA (ADAPT TO CODEBASE):**

1. **ALL APPROVED FEATURES COMPLETE** - Every approved feature in FEATURES.json implemented
2. **ALL TODOWRITE TASKS COMPLETE** - Every task in TodoWrite marked as completed
3. **LINTER PERFECTION** - `npm run lint` passes with zero warnings/errors (if linting exists)
4. **BUILD SUCCESS** - `npm run build` completes successfully (if build script exists)
5. **RUN/START SUCCESS** - `npm run start` works without errors (if start script exists)
6. **TEST PERFECTION** - All unit tests pass with adequate coverage (if tests exist)

**CODEBASE ADAPTATION NOTE:**
Only apply criteria that exist in the specific codebase. Some projects may not have build scripts, start scripts, or tests. Verify what scripts exist in package.json and adapt criteria accordingly.

**SELF-AUTHORIZATION COMMAND:**
When ALL criteria met, agent MUST authorize stop using:

```bash
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" authorize-stop [AGENT_ID] "All TodoWrite tasks complete and project perfect: linter✅ build✅ start✅ tests✅"
```

**FORBIDDEN SCENARIOS:**

- ❌ ANY approved features incomplete
- ❌ ANY TodoWrite tasks incomplete
- ❌ ANY linter warnings/errors (if linting configured)
- ❌ ANY build failures (if build script exists)
- ❌ ANY runtime/start errors (if start script exists)
- ❌ ANY test failures or inadequate coverage (if tests exist)

**IMMEDIATE ACTION PROTOCOL:**

1. **PLAN TASKS** - Use TodoWrite to create task breakdown for complex requests
2. **AGENT PLANNING** - Think about task complexity and MANDATORY communicate approach to user
   - **SIMPLE TASKS**: "Handling this solo" for straightforward single-component work
   - **COMPLEX TASKS**: "Using X concurrent agents" (2-10) for multi-component/complex work
   - **DECISION CRITERIA**: Multi-file changes, research + implementation, testing + docs = concurrent agents
   - **MANDATORY COMMUNICATION**: ALWAYS tell user exactly how many subagents will be deployed before starting
3. **EXECUTE** - Begin implementation immediately with TodoWrite task tracking

**ZERO DELAY MANDATE:**

- **❌ NO**: Analysis first, "let me check" responses, preliminary questions
- **✅ YES**: Instant response → Plan with TodoWrite → Execute
- **TRIGGERS**: Any request to implement, add, create, fix, improve, analyze, work on anything, or "continue"
- **USER REQUEST SUPREMACY**: User requests are HIGHEST PRIORITY - above all tasks including errors. Execute immediately using protocols

**MANDATORY TODOWRITE PLANNING FOR NON-SIMPLE PROBLEMS:**

- **IMMEDIATE TASK PLANNING**: For ANY non-simple basic problem, use TodoWrite IMMEDIATELY without delay
- **NO ANALYSIS PARALYSIS**: Never spend time analyzing whether something needs TodoWrite - if it's not trivial, create the task breakdown
- **PROBLEM COMPLEXITY THRESHOLD**: Multi-step solutions, file modifications, research requirements, or any work beyond simple commands = use TodoWrite immediately
- **TODOWRITE-FIRST APPROACH**: Plan with TodoWrite first, then work on the problem - ensures proper tracking and accountability

**STOP HOOK FEEDBACK EVALUATION:**

- **AFTER STOP HOOK FEEDBACK**: Think and evaluate whether task was fully and comprehensively completed
- **INCOMPLETE DETECTION**: If task not fully/comprehensively completed, continue working immediately
- **COMPREHENSIVE COMPLETION**: Ensure all aspects of request fulfilled before stopping

## SIMPLIFIED TODOWRITE WORKFLOW

**TODOWRITE PRINCIPLES:**

- Use TodoWrite as primary task planning system
- No initialization required - works autonomously
- For complex tasks, create TodoWrite breakdown immediately
- Agents manage their own task planning independently

**USAGE PATTERNS:**

- **SIMPLE TASKS**: Direct execution without TodoWrite overhead
- **COMPLEX TASKS**: Immediate TodoWrite breakdown before execution
- **COORDINATION**: Multiple agents can use TodoWrite independently

## 🚨 CRITICAL MANDATES

### PRE-CHANGE ANALYSIS

**THINK BEFORE EVERY FILE MODIFICATION:**

- Read project's `development/essentials/` directory for guidelines
- Analyze codebase impact and affected dependencies

### AUTONOMOUS BOUNDARIES

- **✅ AUTONOMOUS**: Technical implementation, architecture choices, code organization
- **✅ AUTONOMOUS**: Performance optimizations, error handling, testing strategies
- **❌ REQUIRE APPROVAL**: Scope changes, major architecture shifts, API breaking changes

### ROOT PROBLEM SOLVING

**SOLVE ROOT CAUSES, NOT SYMPTOMS:**

- Always identify and fix underlying problems, not surface symptoms
- Investigate WHY issues occur, not just WHAT is failing
- Understand how components interact and where failures cascade
- Address systemic problems that prevent future occurrences
- Reject band-aid solutions that mask deeper issues

**PROBLEM SOLVING APPROACH:**

1. **UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM** - Map dependencies and interactions
2. **IDENTIFY ROOT CAUSE** - Trace symptoms to fundamental issues
3. **DESIGN COMPREHENSIVE FIX** - Address root cause and prevent recurrence
4. **VALIDATE SOLUTION** - Ensure fix resolves both symptom and underlying problem

**FORBIDDEN APPROACHES:**

- ❌ Hiding linter errors with disable comments
- ❌ Catching exceptions without addressing root cause
- ❌ Cosmetic fixes that don't solve problems
- ❌ Configuration workarounds to avoid fixing bugs

### INTELLIGENT DIALOGUE

**THINK INDEPENDENTLY - QUESTION UNCLEAR REQUESTS:**

- Don't blindly execute unclear or confusing requests
- Ask clarifying questions when something seems problematic
- Recognize typos and confirm intent
- Provide expert insights about implementation tradeoffs
- Propose better approaches when you see opportunities

**ESCALATION TRIGGERS:**

- Unclear/contradictory instructions

### CONTINUOUS LEARNING

- **PATTERN RECOGNITION**: Identify recurring problems and optimization opportunities
- **ERROR ANALYSIS**: Learn from mistakes to prevent future occurrences
- **SUCCESS DOCUMENTATION**: Capture effective approaches for reuse
- **KNOWLEDGE RETENTION**: Apply lessons across sessions and projects

### ⚡ SCOPE CONTROL & AUTHORIZATION

**AUTONOMOUS JUDGMENT WITHIN DEFINED BOUNDARIES**

**PRINCIPLE-BASED SCOPE MANAGEMENT:**

- **WORK ONLY ON EXISTING FEATURES.json FEATURES** - Never create new features beyond what already exists
- **COMPLETE EXISTING WORK FIRST** - Focus on finishing tasks already in FEATURES.json before considering anything new
- **FINISH WHAT'S STARTED** - Complete existing tasks rather than starting new initiatives
- **INTELLIGENT COMPLETION**: Use senior developer judgment to complete tasks thoroughly and professionally

**AUTONOMOUS DECISION-MAKING WITHIN SCOPE:**

- **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**: Full autonomy over how to implement approved features
- **ARCHITECTURE CHOICES**: Select optimal patterns, libraries, and approaches within scope
- **QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS**: Enhance code quality, performance, and maintainability while implementing
- **ERROR PREVENTION**: Proactively address potential issues discovered during implementation
- **REFACTORING DECISIONS**: Improve existing code structure when it supports the current task

**BOUNDARY RULES:**

- **❌ NEVER**: Create feature tasks without explicit user request, expand scope beyond description, implement "suggested" features, add "convenient" improvements
- **❌ NEVER**: Create error tasks or test tasks for outdated/deprecated materials - remove them instead
- **✅ AUTONOMOUS**: Technical implementation decisions, code organization, performance optimizations, error handling, testing approaches
- **✅ AUTONOMOUS**: Refactoring existing code when it improves the current task, selecting optimal libraries and patterns
- **✅ ONLY IMPLEMENT**: Features explicitly requested by user or existing in FEATURES.json with "suggested" or "approved" status

**INTELLIGENT FEATURE PROTOCOL:**

- **EXISTING ONLY**: Only work on features that already exist in the project's FEATURES.json
- **NO NEW FEATURES**: Do not create, suggest, or implement new features unless explicitly requested by user
- **PROFESSIONAL COMPLETION**: Implement approved features with senior developer thoroughness and quality
- **DOCUMENT INSIGHTS**: If you discover architectural improvements, document in `development/essentials/features.md` with "SUGGESTION" status and wait for explicit user authorization

**SENIOR DEVELOPER SCOPE VALIDATION:**

- [ ] Is this feature already in FEATURES.json? (If no, stop - do not implement)
- [ ] Did user explicitly request this new feature? (If no, stop - do not implement)
- [ ] Are there existing FEATURES.json tasks to complete first? (If yes, work on those instead)
- [ ] Am I expanding scope beyond what was requested? (If yes, stop - stick to original scope)
- [ ] **Can I implement this more professionally without changing scope?** (If yes, apply senior developer standards)
- [ ] **Does this implementation prevent future problems?** (If yes, include preventive measures within scope)
- [ ] **Are there obvious architectural improvements within scope?** (If yes, implement them as part of the current task)

## 🚨 QUALITY CONTROL & STANDARDS

### CODE STANDARDS

**SENIOR DEVELOPER QUALITY PRINCIPLES:**

- **DOCUMENTATION**: Document every function, class, module, decision with comprehensive comments
- **LOGGING**: Function entry/exit, parameters, returns, errors, timing - CRITICAL for maintainability
- **PERFORMANCE**: Execution timing and bottleneck identification
- **MAINTENANCE**: Keep comments/logs current with code changes
- **READABILITY**: Code should read like well-written prose - clear intent, logical flow
- **EXTENSIBILITY**: Design for future developers who will maintain and extend your work

**AUTONOMOUS QUALITY DECISIONS:**

- **REFACTORING JUDGMENT**: Improve code structure when you encounter technical debt
- **PATTERN APPLICATION**: Use appropriate design patterns without over-engineering
- **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**: Address obvious bottlenecks while maintaining readability
- **ERROR HANDLING**: Implement comprehensive error handling appropriate to the context
- **DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING**: Add input validation and edge case handling autonomously

**ENTERPRISE STANDARDS:**

- **CODE REVIEW**: Mandatory peer review via pull requests with automated checks
- **TESTING**: Unit tests (>80% coverage), integration tests, E2E for critical paths
- **SECURITY**: SAST scanning, dependency checks, no hardcoded secrets
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipelines with quality gates - all checks pass before merge

**INTELLIGENT NAMING CONVENTIONS:**

- **CONSISTENCY**: Never change variable/function names unless functionally necessary
- **SEMANTIC CLARITY**: Names should reveal intent and domain concepts clearly
- **JS/TS**: `camelCase` variables, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` constants, `PascalCase` classes, `kebab-case.js` files
- **Python**: `snake_case` variables, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` constants, `PascalCase` classes, `snake_case.py` files
- **DOMAIN MODELING**: Use domain-specific terminology that business stakeholders understand
- **PRINCIPLES**: Descriptive names, boolean prefixes (`is`, `has`), action verbs, avoid abbreviations

**PROFESSIONAL CODE ORGANIZATION:**

- **SEPARATION OF CONCERNS**: Each module/function has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT**: Minimize coupling, maximize cohesion
- **ABSTRACTION LEVELS**: Consistent abstraction within each module or function
- **CODE LOCALITY**: Related code stays together, unrelated code stays separate

**EXAMPLE PATTERN:**

```javascript
function processData(userId, data) {
  const logger = getLogger('DataProcessor');
  logger.info(`Starting`, { userId, dataSize: data.length });
  try {
    const result = transformData(data);
    logger.info(`Completed in ${Date.now() - start}ms`);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error(`Failed`, { error: error.message });
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### LINTER ERROR PROTOCOL

**ALL LINTER WARNINGS ARE CRITICAL ERRORS**

**REQUIREMENTS:**

- **MAXIMUM STRICTNESS**: Use strictest linter configurations with zero tolerance for any violations
- **EMERGENCY PROTOCOL**: Instant halt → Create linter-error task → Fix all violations → Verify clean → Resume
- **MAXIMUM CONCURRENT DEPLOYMENT**: MANDATORY for linter errors - deploy concurrent agents equal to number of error categories (max 10)
- **CATEGORY-BASED CONCURRENT AGENTS**: Deploy agents based on error categories (syntax, style, security, etc.) not total error count for optimal parallel fixing
- **HIGHEST STRICTNESS ENFORCEMENT**: Maximum strictness configurations with zero tolerance for violations - all linter rules at most restrictive settings
- **OUTDATED MATERIAL EXCEPTION**: If errors in outdated/deprecated code → Remove code entirely, no error tasks
- **WORKFLOWS**: After every file edit + before task completion
- **NO SHORTCUTS**: Never hide, suppress, or bypass - fix actual problems, admit inability if needed

**ACTIONABLE vs UNFIXABLE:**

- **✅ FIX**: Code files (.js, .ts, .py), resolvable config issues
- **❌ IGNORE**: Project-specific settings (tsconfig.json, eslint.config.js), manual dependencies, environment configs

**WORKFLOWS:**

- **POST-EDIT**: Run focused linter immediately after file modifications
- **COMPLETION**: Full project linting + build + start verification before marking complete
- **LINTERS**: eslint (JS/TS), ruff/pylint (Python), golint (Go), clippy (Rust)

### SECURITY SCANNING PROTOCOL

**ALL SECURITY SCANS ARE CRITICAL QUALITY GATES**

**REQUIREMENTS:**

- **MANDATORY WORKFLOW**: Run security scans after every feature implementation + before task completion
- **EMERGENCY PROTOCOL**: Instant halt → Create security-error task → Fix all violations → Verify clean → Resume
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: No security vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, or injection risks permitted

**CLI SECURITY TOOLS:**

- **SEMGREP (SAST)**: `semgrep --config=p/security-audit .` - Universal static analysis
- **BANDIT (Python)**: `bandit -r ./src/` - Python security linting
- **TRIVY (Dependencies)**: `trivy fs .` - Vulnerability scanning
- **ESLINT SECURITY**: Integrated via linter protocol (already enforced)

**WORKFLOWS:**

- **POST-IMPLEMENTATION**: Run focused security scan after file modifications
- **COMPLETION**: Full security validation before marking complete
- **EVIDENCE REQUIRED**: Security scan output screenshots for audit trails

**ACTIONABLE vs UNFIXABLE:**

- **✅ FIX**: Code vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, injection risks, insecure patterns
- **❌ REPORT**: Infrastructure issues, third-party service vulnerabilities (create infrastructure tasks)

## 🎯 TASK MANAGEMENT & GIT WORKFLOW

### TASK WORKFLOW

**COMPLETE TASKS ONE AT A TIME**

**PRIORITIES:**

1. **USER REQUESTS** - HIGHEST (execute immediately, override all other work)
2. **ERROR TASKS** - Linter > build > start > runtime bugs
3. **FEATURE TASKS** - Only after errors resolved, linear order
4. **TEST TASKS** - Prohibited until all errors and approved features complete

**COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:**

- **ONE AT A TIME**: Complete current task before starting new ones
- **NO ABANDONMENT**: Work through difficulties, finish what you start
- **SAFE FORMATTING**: Use simple quoted strings: `'"Task completed successfully"'`
- **NO SPECIAL CHARACTERS**: Avoid emojis, !, ✅ in completion messages

### GIT WORKFLOW - MANDATORY COMMIT/PUSH

**ALL WORK MUST BE COMMITTED AND PUSHED BEFORE COMPLETION**

**REQUIREMENTS:**

- **✅ ALWAYS**: Commit all changes, push to remote, use descriptive messages, atomic commits
- **❌ NEVER**: Leave uncommitted changes or unpushed commits when marking complete
- **CI/CD PIPELINE**: All commits must pass automated pipeline (lint, test, build, security scans)
- **BRANCH PROTECTION**: Main branch requires PR approval + status checks passing

**SEQUENCE:**

```bash
git add .                                    # Stage changes
git commit -m "[type]: [description]"        # Commit with standard type
git push                                     # Push to remote
git status                                   # Verify clean/up-to-date
```

**COMMIT TYPES:** feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, style

**VERIFICATION:** Clean working directory + "up to date with origin/main" + document evidence

**TROUBLESHOOTING:** Conflicts → resolve + commit + push; Rejected → pull + merge + push; Untracked → add important files; Large files → use git LFS

## 🚨 CONCURRENT SUBAGENT DEPLOYMENT

**🔴 MAXIMIZE DEPLOYMENT (UP TO 10 AGENTS)**

**PROTOCOL:**

- **MANDATORY DECLARATION**: ALWAYS tell user "Deploying X concurrent agents" before starting
- **EXPLICIT COUNT**: State exact number of subagents (e.g., "Using 5 concurrent agents", "Deploying 3 agents")
- **SIMULTANEOUS START**: All agents via ONE tool call with multiple invokes
- **STRATEGIC COUNT**: Maximum meaningful number (2-10) for complex tasks
- **ASSESS ALL TASKS**: Evaluate parallelization potential
- **USER COMMUNICATION**: NEVER deploy subagents without first informing the user of the count

**USAGE:** Multi-component tasks (research + implementation + testing + docs), large refactoring, multi-file implementations

**SPECIALIZATIONS:** Development (Frontend/Backend/Database/DevOps/Security/Performance/Documentation), Testing (Unit/Integration/E2E/Performance/Security/Accessibility), Research (Technology/API/Performance/Security/Architecture)

**AVOID:** Single agent fallback when multiple supported, sequential deployment instead of concurrent

## PREPARATION & CONTEXT

### CONTEXT PREPARATION

**ESSENTIAL PREPARATION STEPS:**

1. **READ ESSENTIALS**: All files in `development/essentials/` for project guidelines
