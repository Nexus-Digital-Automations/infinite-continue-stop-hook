**üî¥ CRITICAL: THE INSTANT A USER MAKES ANY REQUEST - IMMEDIATELY CREATE TASK**

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS - NO EXCEPTIONS:**
1. **STOP EVERYTHING IMMEDIATELY** - The moment user communicates anything
2. **CREATE TASK INSTANTLY** - Use TaskManager API before ANY other action

## üö® ERROR HANDLING & QUALITY PROTOCOLS

### MANDATORY ERROR RESPONSE - IMMEDIATE TASK CREATION REQUIRED
1. **DETECT** any error ‚Üí **INSTANTLY CREATE CATEGORIZED TASK IMMEDIATELY**:
   - Linter errors ‚Üí `category: 'linter-error'` - **CREATE TASK INSTANTLY**
   - Build failures ‚Üí `category: 'build-error'` - **CREATE TASK INSTANTLY**
   - Runtime errors ‚Üí `category: 'error'` - **CREATE TASK INSTANTLY**
   - Test failures ‚Üí `category: 'test-error'` - **CREATE TASK INSTANTLY**
2. **ATTEMPT IMMEDIATE FIX** (< 2 minutes) OR work on task
3. **VERIFY** fix and document resolution

**üî¥ CRITICAL:** Error detection = IMMEDIATE task creation. No delays, no analysis first - create task the instant an error is identified.

**FORBIDDEN:** Ignoring errors, suppressing messages, or implementing workarounds

### üö® **ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT - LINTER CHECKS BEFORE TASK COMPLETION:**
**‚ùå NEVER mark a task complete without running linter checks first**
**‚úÖ ALWAYS run npm run lint (or equivalent) before marking any task as completed**
**‚úÖ ALWAYS fix all linting errors before task completion**
**‚úÖ ALWAYS provide validation evidence showing linter results**

üìã **MANDATORY LINTER CHECK SEQUENCE:**
1. **Complete your implementation work**
2. **IMMEDIATELY run linter checks**: npm run lint, npm run typecheck, etc.
3. **Fix any errors found** - do not ignore or suppress
4. **Re-run linter to verify fixes**
5. **ONLY THEN mark task as completed** with validation evidence

üî¥ **LINTER CHECK FAILURE PROTOCOL:**
- If linting fails ‚Üí Create new linter-error task IMMEDIATELY
- If type errors found ‚Üí Create new error task IMMEDIATELY
- DO NOT mark original task complete until ALL validation passes
- Provide command outputs as evidence of successful validation

### ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ISSUE MASKING
**ALWAYS FIX ROOT CAUSE - NEVER HIDE PROBLEMS**

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:**
- ‚ùå MASK validation errors - Fix the validation logic, don't bypass it
- ‚ùå SUPPRESS error messages - Fix the error, don't hide it
- ‚ùå BYPASS quality checks - Fix the code to pass checks
- ‚ùå IMPLEMENT WORKAROUNDS - Fix the root cause, don't work around it
- ‚ùå HIDE FAILING TESTS - Fix the tests or code, don't disable them
- ‚ùå IGNORE LINTING ERRORS - Fix the linting violations
- ‚ùå DISABLE WARNINGS OR CHECKS - Address what's causing the warnings

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS PROTOCOL:**
1. **IDENTIFY** the true root cause
2. **ANALYZE** why the issue exists
3. **FIX** the underlying problem
4. **VALIDATE** the fix resolves the issue
5. **DOCUMENT** the resolution

**FORBIDDEN MASKING EXAMPLES:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - Masking validation
if (!result.isValid) return { success: true };

// ‚úÖ REQUIRED - Fixing validation
if (!result.isValid) {
    fixValidationIssue(result.errors);
    // Re-run validation to ensure it passes
}
```

**QUALITY GATE PRINCIPLE:** Every error is a quality gate that must be properly addressed - never masked, always fixed.

### THINKING & VALIDATION PROTOCOLS

**THINKING LEVELS:**
- **ULTRATHINK**: System architecture, task planning, priority evaluation
- **THINK HARD**: Complex refactoring, debugging, task management
- **MANDATORY**: All task operations (creation, categorization, completion)

**EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLETION:**
1. Run validation commands - show all outputs
2. Test functionality manually - demonstrate it works
3. Verify requirements met - list each satisfied requirement
4. Provide evidence - paste command outputs proving success


## üéØ TASK CATEGORY & PRIORITY SYSTEM

# Linter error (highest priority)
node -e 'const TaskManager = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); const tm = new TaskManager("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json"); tm.createTask({title: "Fix [specific error]", category: "linter-error", mode: "DEVELOPMENT"}).then(id => console.log("Created:", id));'

# Feature implementation
node -e 'const TaskManager = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); const tm = new TaskManager("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json"); tm.createTask({title: "Implement [feature]", category: "missing-feature", mode: "DEVELOPMENT"}).then(id => console.log("Created:", id));'

# Research task
node -e 'const TaskManager = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); const tm = new TaskManager("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json"); tm.createTask({title: "Research [topic]", category: "research", mode: "DEVELOPMENT"}).then(id => console.log("Created:", id));'
```

## üö® TASK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS

**ALWAYS CREATE TASKS FOR:**
- Every user request/instruction
- All detected errors (linting, runtime, build, test failures)
- Performance issues and security vulnerabilities
- Code quality opportunities and missing functionality
- Integration issues and improvement opportunities

**WORKFLOW:** User request ‚Üí Create task ‚Üí Check existing ‚Üí Execute

### CATEGORY-BASED TASK CREATION
**üî¥ CATEGORY DETECTION = IMMEDIATE TASK CREATION - ABSOLUTE MANDATE**

**üö® THE INSTANT ANY OPPORTUNITY IS DETECTED - IMMEDIATELY CREATE TASK:**

**CRITICAL ERRORS (Create INSTANTLY):**
- Linter errors ‚Üí `category: 'linter-error'` - **IMMEDIATE TASK CREATION**
- Build failures ‚Üí `category: 'build-error'` - **IMMEDIATE TASK CREATION**

- **OPPORTUNITY SPOTTED = IMMEDIATE TASK CREATION** - Within seconds of detection
- **NO ANALYSIS PARALYSIS** - Task creation happens BEFORE analysis
- **NO HESITATION ALLOWED** - Create task the instant opportunity is identified
- **ALWAYS SPECIFY CATEGORY** - Task must have appropriate category assigned
- **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED** - This is not a suggestion, it is a mandate
- Include relevant research reports in task important_files

## üö® BASH ESCAPING PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL RULE: ALWAYS USE SINGLE QUOTES FOR NODE -E COMMANDS**

**Common Errors:** SyntaxError from improper quote escaping, shell interference with JavaScript

**CORRECT PATTERNS:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Single quotes for shell, double quotes for JavaScript
node -e 'const tm = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); tm.createTask({title: "Task"});'

# ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - Double quotes for outer shell
node -e "const tm = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager');"
```

**Troubleshooting:** Switch to single quotes, use double quotes inside JavaScript, create temp file for complex commands

## üö® STRATEGIC CONCURRENT TASK SUBAGENT DEPLOYMENT

**üî¥ MASSIVE CONCURRENT DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:**
**üö® DEPLOY AS MANY CONCURRENT SIMULTANEOUS TASK SUBAGENTS AS APPROPRIATE - MAXIMIZE CONCURRENT DEPLOYMENT üö®**

**üî¥ ABSOLUTE MANDATE: ALWAYS MAXIMIZE CONCURRENT SIMULTANEOUS AGENTS**

Deploy as many concurrent task subagents simultaneously as the task can meaningfully utilize (up to 10 maximum). **MAXIMIZE CONCURRENT TASK SUBAGENTS** - always aim for the highest number of concurrent task subagents that makes sense for the task's parallelizable components to achieve optimal efficiency.

**üö® ULTRA-AGGRESSIVE DEPLOYMENT MANDATE:**
- **‚úÖ DEFAULT TO MAXIMUM CONCURRENT AGENTS** - When in doubt, deploy as many concurrent simultaneous task subagents as appropriate (aim for 8-10)
- **üö® SIMULTANEOUS DEPLOYMENT ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED** - All agents must start working at the EXACT SAME TIME - NO SEQUENTIAL STARTS
- **üö® AT THE SAME TIME ENFORCEMENT** - Launch ALL task subagents SIMULTANEOUSLY in one coordinated deployment - never one after another
- **‚úÖ MAXIMIZE PARALLELIZATION** - Break work into as many parallel streams as logically possible  
- **‚úÖ CONCURRENT-FIRST MINDSET** - Always look for opportunities to run multiple agents simultaneously
- **‚úÖ SCALE UP TO MAXIMUM** - Use as many agents as the task can meaningfully support for complex multi-faceted work
- **‚úÖ PARALLEL EVERYTHING** - Research, implementation, testing, documentation should run concurrently
- **‚ö° MORE CONCURRENT AGENTS = FASTER COMPLETION** - Additional concurrent processing almost always improves speed
- **üö® CONCURRENT SIMULTANEOUS EXECUTION IS MANDATORY** - Never run agents sequentially when they can run simultaneously AT THE SAME TIME

**üî¥ CONCURRENT EXECUTION MANDATE:**
**ALWAYS USE CONCURRENT TASK SUBAGENTS WHEN USING MULTIPLE AGENTS FOR A TASK**

- **‚úÖ MULTIPLE AGENTS = CONCURRENT EXECUTION** - If task requires multiple agents, they MUST run concurrently AT THE SAME TIME
- **‚ùå NEVER SEQUENTIAL MULTI-AGENT WORK** - Multiple agents running one after another is FORBIDDEN unless dependent
- **üö® SIMULTANEOUS DEPLOYMENT ONLY** - All agents for a task must start AT THE EXACT SAME TIME in one coordinated launch
- **üö® AT THE SAME TIME REQUIREMENT** - No staggered starts, no sequential deployment - ALL AGENTS START SIMULTANEOUSLY
- **‚úÖ PARALLEL PROCESSING MANDATE** - Multiple agents working on same task = concurrent processing required AT THE SAME TIME
- **‚ö° CONCURRENT IS THE ONLY WAY** - Single-threaded multi-agent execution is strictly prohibited - must be AT THE SAME TIME

**üî¥ SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION EXCEPTION:**
**SEQUENTIAL AGENTS ALLOWED ONLY FOR DEPENDENCY CHAINS**

- **‚úÖ DEPENDENCY-BASED SEQUENTIAL** - Sequential execution ONLY when one agent's output feeds into another
- **‚úÖ RESEARCH ‚Üí IMPLEMENTATION** - Research agent completes first, then implementation agent uses results
- **‚úÖ ANALYSIS ‚Üí ACTION** - Analysis agent provides data, then action agent processes results
- **‚ùå NO OTHER SEQUENTIAL REASONS** - Any sequential execution without dependency chain is FORBIDDEN
- **üîó CLEAR DEPENDENCY REQUIREMENT** - Must have explicit data/result dependency to justify sequential execution

**üö® APPROPRIATE CONCURRENT TASK SUBAGENT USAGE:**
- **‚úÖ COMPLEX MULTI-COMPONENT TASKS** - Research, implementation, testing, documentation can run in parallel
- **‚úÖ LARGE SCALE REFACTORING** - Multiple files/modules can be handled simultaneously  
- **‚úÖ COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS** - Different aspects can be analyzed concurrently
- **‚ùå SIMPLE SINGLE-FILE EDITS** - One agent is often sufficient and more efficient
- **‚ùå INHERENTLY SEQUENTIAL WORK** - Tasks that must be done in specific order
- **‚ùå TRIVIAL OPERATIONS** - File reads, simple queries, basic validation

### üéØ Synchronized Completion Protocol
**CRITICAL**: All task subagents must finish within same timeframe for optimal efficiency

**COMPLETION SYNCHRONIZATION STRATEGY:**
1. **Pre-Flight Load Balancing**: Distribute work complexity evenly across all 10 task subagents
2. **Coordinated Start**: All task subagents begin execution simultaneously 
3. **Progress Checkpoints**: 25%, 50%, 75% completion status reporting to main agent
4. **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Redistribute workload if any task subagent falls behind schedule
5. **Synchronized Quality Gates**: All task subagents run validation simultaneously in final phase
6. **Coordinated Completion**: Main agent waits for ALL task subagents before marking task complete

### üöÄ Universal Task Subagent Deployment
**MANDATORY SPECIALIZATIONS BY MODE:**

- **DEVELOPMENT**: Frontend, Backend, Database, DevOps, Security specialists
- **TESTING**: Unit Test, Integration Test, E2E Test, Performance Test, Security Test specialists  
- **RESEARCH**: Technology Evaluator, API Analyst, Performance Researcher, Security Auditor, UX Researcher
- **DEBUGGING**: Error Analysis, Performance Profiling, Security Audit, Code Quality, System Integration specialists
- **REFACTORING**: Architecture, Performance, Code Quality, Documentation, Testing specialists

### üîÑ Coordination & Timing Controls
**LOAD BALANCING STRATEGIES:**
- **Equal Complexity Distribution**: Each task subagent receives ~10% of total work complexity (10 task subagents)
- **Dependency-Aware Scheduling**: Sequential tasks distributed to maintain parallel execution
- **Failure Recovery**: If any task subagent fails, redistribute work to remaining agents
- **Completion Buffer**: Build in 10-15% time buffer for synchronization delays

**INTEGRATION CHECKPOINTS:**
- **Context Sharing**: Critical information passed between task subagents at each checkpoint
- **Quality Verification**: Each task subagent validates outputs meet perfection standards
- **Conflict Resolution**: Main agent resolves any conflicting recommendations
- **Final Integration**: All task subagent outputs merged into cohesive deliverable

**DEPLOYMENT PATTERN:** Think ‚Üí Map Work Distribution ‚Üí Balance Complexity ‚Üí Deploy UP TO 10 Agents Simultaneously ‚Üí Monitor Progress ‚Üí Synchronize Completion


## üö® CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

**Always check for ABOUT.md files** before editing code (current directory, parent directories, subdirectories)

## üö® DEVELOPMENT ESSENTIALS REVIEW MANDATE

**üî¥ ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: ALWAYS READ/REVIEW DEVELOPMENT/ESSENTIALS DIRECTORY**

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL:**
1. **CHECK development/essentials/** - Always check if development/essentials directory exists
2. **READ ALL ESSENTIAL FILES** - Review every file in development/essentials before starting any work
3. **CRITICAL CONTEXT** - Files in development/essentials contain critical project context and requirements
4. **NEVER SKIP** - Never begin implementation without reviewing essentials directory content
5. **UPDATE AWARENESS** - Re-check development/essentials if it gets created during project lifecycle

**ESSENTIAL FILES PRIORITY:**
- **Project-specific constraints** - Technical limitations and requirements
- **Architecture decisions** - Core design patterns and principles  
- **Security requirements** - Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Performance standards** - Optimization requirements and benchmarks
- **Integration specifications** - External service dependencies and protocols
- **Deployment considerations** - Environment-specific configurations

**WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:**
- **Before task execution** - Review development/essentials as first step
- **During planning** - Reference essentials for implementation decisions
- **For complex tasks** - Include essentials review in task dependencies
- **When blocked** - Check essentials for guidance and constraints

**NOTE**: If development/essentials directory doesn't exist, this requirement is dormant until the directory is created.

## üö® RESEARCH REPORTS INTEGRATION & DEPENDENCY SYSTEM

**üî¥ ABSOLUTE MANDATE: ALWAYS READ RELEVANT RESEARCH REPORTS FIRST**

**MANDATORY**: Always check `development/reports/` and `development/research-reports/` for relevant research reports before starting any task

2. **ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED**: ADD relevant reports to important_files when creating tasks  
3. **READ reports FIRST** before implementing to leverage existing research
4. **NEVER START IMPLEMENTATION** without reading applicable research reports
5. **INCLUDE REPORTS AS IMPORTANT FILES** in all related TODO.json tasks

**üö® RESEARCH REPORT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ALWAYS include relevant research reports** in task important_files

- **LEVERAGE existing research** to inform implementation decisions
- **REFERENCE research findings** in implementation approach
- **UPDATE research reports** if new findings discovered during implementation

## üö® MANDATORY RESEARCH TASK CREATION FOR COMPLEX WORK

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Create research tasks as dependencies for any complex implementation work

- **üì± UI/UX implementations** - Research design patterns, accessibility, user experience best practices

**DEPENDENCY CREATION:** Create dependency task first, then dependent task with dependencies array.

**üö® DEPENDENCY SYSTEM BEHAVIOR:**
- **Dependencies ALWAYS come first** in task queue regardless of category
- **Any task can depend on any other task** - not limited to research dependencies
- **Dependent tasks are BLOCKED** until all dependencies complete  
- **Task claiming will redirect** to dependency tasks with instructions
- **Use TaskManager API** for automatic dependency detection and guidance

## üö® CODING STANDARDS

**MANDATORY**: All agents MUST follow the standardized coding conventions defined in the global CLAUDE.md at `/Users/jeremyparker/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

These standards ensure consistency across large codebases and multi-agent collaboration, covering:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Industry standard + TypeScript strict mode
- **Python**: Black + Ruff + mypy strict mode  
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Naming patterns, error handling, logging
- **Configuration Files**: .editorconfig, eslint.config.mjs, pyproject.toml
- **Enforcement Protocol**: Zero-tolerance linting and validation requirements

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Refer to global CLAUDE.md for complete coding standards - this prevents duplication and ensures all projects use identical standards.

- **‚ùå NEVER EDIT settings.json** - `/Users/jeremyparker/.claude/settings.json` is ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN to modify
- **‚ùå NEVER TOUCH GLOBAL SETTINGS** - Any modification to global Claude settings is prohibited
- **‚ùå NEVER SUGGEST SETTINGS CHANGES** - Do not recommend editing global configuration files
- **‚ùå NEVER ACCESS SETTINGS FILES** - Avoid reading or writing to any Claude settings files

**GOLDEN RULE:** Global Claude settings at `/Users/jeremyparker/.claude/settings.json` are **UNTOUCHABLE** - treat as read-only system files

## üö® WORKFLOW PROTOCOLS

**TODO.json INTERACTION PROTOCOL:**
**MANDATORY**: ALWAYS USE THE TASKMANAGER API WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE TODO.JSON

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: ALL TODO.json operations (read/write) MUST use TaskManager API exclusively.

**‚úÖ ALLOWED**: Reading TODO.json as a file (Read tool only) for viewing/inspection
**‚úÖ CORRECT**: TaskManager API for ALL TODO.json interactions (create, update, delete, modify, reorder)
**‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: Any write operations directly to TODO.json file
**‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: fs.readFileSync/writeFileSync on TODO.json for modifications
**‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: require('./TODO.json') for any mutations
**‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: JSON.parse/JSON.stringify operations that modify TODO.json
**‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: Any direct file manipulation beyond reading for inspection

**GOLDEN RULE**: TODO.json is READ-ONLY as a file. ALL modifications MUST go through TaskManager API.

**ALWAYS USE THESE COMMANDS INSTEAD:**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Use single quotes for all node -e commands to prevent bash escaping errors**

```bash
# Init agent (mandatory first step)
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/tm-universal.js" init --project "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook"

# Create/update tasks (use TaskManager API - see logging example for pattern)
# Universal script for status updates and task management
```

## üö® TASKMANAGER API ENDPOINT DOCUMENTATION

**üì° DISCOVER AVAILABLE API METHODS AND ENDPOINTS:**

Use the following endpoint to get comprehensive instructions for all TaskManager API endpoints, methods, and capabilities:

```bash
# Get complete API documentation and available methods
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" methods

# Alternative: Get methods documentation with examples
node -e 'const TaskManager = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); console.log(TaskManager.getApiDocumentation());'
```

**üîç TASKMANAGER API DISCOVERY:**
- **Endpoint Documentation**: Complete list of all available API methods
- **Usage Examples**: Code examples for each method with proper syntax
- **Parameter Definitions**: Required and optional parameters for each endpoint
- **Response Formats**: Expected response structures and data types
- **Error Handling**: Error codes and troubleshooting guidance
- **Best Practices**: Recommended usage patterns and conventions

**MANDATORY USAGE:**
- **ALWAYS check available methods** before using TaskManager API
- **REFER to documentation** for correct parameter usage
- **USE PROVIDED EXAMPLES** to ensure proper implementation
- **VALIDATE responses** according to documented formats

## üö® ROOT FOLDER ORGANIZATION POLICY

**MANDATORY ROOT FOLDER CLEANLINESS:**
- **KEEP ROOT FOLDER CLEAN** - Only essential project files in root directory
- **Create development subdirectories** for reports, research, and documentation if they don't exist
- **Move analysis files, reports, and documentation** to appropriate subdirectories

**ALLOWED IN ROOT DIRECTORY:**
- **Core project files**: package.json, README.md, CLAUDE.md, TODO.json, DONE.json
- **Configuration files**: .eslintrc, .gitignore, jest.config.js, etc.
- **Build/deployment files**: Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, etc.
- **License and legal**: LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.

**ORGANIZE INTO SUBDIRECTORIES:**
- **Reports and analysis** ‚Üí `development/reports/` 
- **Research documentation** ‚Üí `development/research-reports/`
- **Development notes** ‚Üí `development/notes/`
- **Backup files** ‚Üí `backups/`

## üö® MANDATORY GIT WORKFLOW

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: ALWAYS commit and push work after EVERY task completion

### üî¥ MANDATORY COMMIT PROTOCOL - NO EXCEPTIONS

**AFTER COMPLETING ANY TASK - IMMEDIATELY RUN:**

```bash
# 1. Stage all changes
git add -A

# 2. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: [brief description of what was accomplished]

- [bullet point of specific changes made]
- [another accomplishment]
- [any fixes or improvements]

ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# 3. MANDATORY - Push to remote repository
git push
```

### üìù COMMIT MESSAGE STANDARDS

**REQUIRED FORMAT:**
- **Type**: Use conventional commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- **Description**: Brief summary of what was accomplished
- **Body**: Bullet points of specific changes
- **Footer**: Always include Claude Code attribution

**EXAMPLE:** `git commit -m "feat: add feature\n\n- Specific changes\n- Accomplishments\n\nü§ñ Generated with Claude Code\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### ‚ö° WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE:**
1. **Complete Task** - Finish all implementation and testing
2. **Validate Work** - Run all validation commands and verify results
3. **Stage Changes** - `git add -A` to include all modifications
4. **Commit Work** - Use descriptive commit message with proper format
5. **Push Remote** - `git push` to ensure work is backed up and shared
6. **Mark Task Complete** - Update TaskManager with completion status

**üö® ABSOLUTE RULES:**
- **NEVER skip git commit and push** after completing any task
- **ALWAYS use descriptive commit messages** with bullet points
- **ALWAYS push to remote** - local commits are not sufficient
- **COMMIT BEFORE** marking tasks as completed in TaskManager

**TASK COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:**

**MANDATORY COMPLETION PROTOCOL**: At the end of EVERY task execution, you MUST mark tasks as completed when they are finished.

**Task Completion API:**
```bash
# Initialize TaskManager and mark task as completed
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json'); tm.updateTaskStatus('task-1', 'completed').then(() => console.log('‚úÖ Task marked as completed'));"

# Alternative: Get current task and mark it completed
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json'); tm.getCurrentTask().then(async (task) => { if (task) { await tm.updateTaskStatus(task.id, 'completed'); console.log('‚úÖ Current task completed:', task.id); } else { console.log('No active task found'); } });"
```

**TASK COMPLETION VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:**

**Evidence-Based Completion Protocol:**
1. **Run validation commands** - Provide command outputs showing status
2. **Test functionality** - Verify the implementation works as expected  
3. **Confirm requirements** - Document how each requirement was satisfied
4. **Completion summary** - Brief statement with supporting evidence

**Completion Summary Format:**
```
‚Ä¢ Functionality: [Description of what was implemented/fixed]
‚Ä¢ Validation: [Command outputs showing results]  
‚Ä¢ Requirements: [How user requirements were addressed]
‚Ä¢ Status: Task completed and verified
```

**Completion Standards:**
- Provide evidence of successful implementation
- Include relevant command outputs or test results
- Confirm all user requirements have been satisfied

## üö® CONTINUE COMMAND PROTOCOL

**üî¥ CRITICAL: USER "CONTINUE" COMMAND HANDLING**

**WHEN USER SAYS "CONTINUE" - MANDATORY PROTOCOL:**

1. **CHECK CURRENT TASK STATUS FIRST**:
   ```bash
   node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json'); tm.getCurrentTask('[YOUR_AGENT_ID]').then(task => console.log(task ? JSON.stringify(task, null, 2) : 'No active task'));"
   ```

2. **IF CURRENT TASK EXISTS AND IN PROGRESS**:
   - **‚úÖ CONTINUE WORKING** on the current task
   - **‚úÖ RESUME IMPLEMENTATION** from where you left off
   - **‚úÖ COMPLETE THE TASK** following all validation protocols
   - **‚ùå DO NOT CREATE NEW TASKS** - focus on completing current work

3. **IF NO CURRENT TASK OR TASK COMPLETED**:
   - **‚úÖ CHECK FOR NEXT AVAILABLE TASK**:
   ```bash
   node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" list '{"status": "pending"}'
   ```
   - **‚úÖ CLAIM HIGHEST PRIORITY AVAILABLE TASK**
   - **‚úÖ BEGIN WORKING ON CLAIMED TASK**
   - **‚úÖ FOLLOW FULL IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW**

4. **CONTINUE COMMAND WORKFLOW**:
   ```
   User says "continue" ‚Üí Check current task ‚Üí IF task exists: resume work ‚Üí IF no task: claim next task ‚Üí Execute work ‚Üí Complete task ‚Üí Ready for next "continue"
   ```

**üö® CONTINUE COMMAND ENFORCEMENT:**
- **‚ùå NEVER CREATE NEW TASKS** when user says "continue"
- **‚úÖ ALWAYS CHECK EXISTING WORK FIRST** - current task has priority
- **‚úÖ SEAMLESS TRANSITION** - continue current or start next without pause
- **‚úÖ WORK TO COMPLETION** - finish tasks fully before considering new ones
- **‚úÖ MAINTAIN AGENT STATE** - use consistent agent ID throughout session

## üö® EXECUTION WORKFLOW

**STANDARD APPROACH:**
1. **Create Task** - Follow task creation mandate
2. **Evaluate Existing Tasks** - Check if can modify existing vs create new
3. **Think First** - Use appropriate thinking level (think/think hard/ultrathink)
4. **Initialize Agent** - Use TaskManager API initialization
5. **Deploy Task Subagents** - Maximize concurrent task subagents when appropriate
6. **Implement & Validate** - Execute with evidence-based completion
7. **Complete Tasks** - Mark completed via TaskManager API

## üö® INFINITE OPERATION MANDATE - NO TIME LIMITS

**üî¥ ABSOLUTE MANDATE: OPERATE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE - NO TIME CONSTRAINTS**

**INFINITE OPERATION PROTOCOL:**
- **‚è∞ NO TIME LIMITS** - Continue working indefinitely until natural completion or user stop
- **üîÑ MULTIPLE ROUNDS** - Continue across multiple tasks
- **üìã MULTIPLE TASKS** - Complete as many as possible
- **üöÄ TASK SUBAGENT DEPLOYMENT** - Use when appropriate

## üö® INFINITE CONTINUE HOOK SYSTEM - NEVER STOP PROTOCOL

**üî¥ ABSOLUTE MANDATE: NEVER ALLOW STOPS UNLESS ENDPOINT TRIGGERED**

### üõë STOP CONTROL PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **‚ùå NEVER ALLOW NATURAL STOPS** - System must continue infinitely
- **‚úÖ ONLY ENDPOINT CAN STOP** - Specific API endpoint must be called to trigger stop
- **üîí ONE STOP ONLY** - After endpoint triggered, allow only ONE stop, then return to never-stop mode
- **üîÑ ALWAYS INSTRUCT** - Provide detailed guidance on task continuation vs next task acquisition


### üîÑ CONTINUOUS OPERATION MANDATE

**OPERATION PRINCIPLES:**
- **üåê INFINITE LOOP** - Never allow natural termination
- **üéØ TASK-FOCUSED** - Always guide agents toward productive work
- **üìä STATUS-AWARE** - Understand current agent state and provide appropriate guidance
- **üîó WORKFLOW-DRIVEN** - Maintain continuous task progression flow


**STOP SEQUENCE:**
1. **Endpoint called** ‚Üí Set stop_allowed flag to true
2. **Next stop hook trigger** ‚Üí Allow ONE stop and reset flag  
3. **Subsequent triggers** ‚Üí Return to never-stop infinite mode

### üéõÔ∏è HOOK BEHAVIOR SPECIFICATION

**STOP HOOK RESPONSE CODES:**
- **Exit Code 2 (Continue)** - Default infinite mode, never allow stops
- **Exit Code 0 (Allow Stop)** - ONLY when endpoint triggered and single-use flag active
- **Always provide instructive messaging** regardless of exit code

**INFINITE CONTINUE HOOK SYSTEM:**
- **Setup**: `node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/setup-infinite-hook.js" "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook"`
- **Coverage**: development (80%), testing/debugging/refactoring (95%)
- **Stop Control**: API endpoint required for stop authorization
