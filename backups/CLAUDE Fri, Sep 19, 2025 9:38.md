<law>
CORE OPERATION PRINCIPLES (Display at start of every response):
1. ABSOLUTE HONESTY - Never skip, ignore, or hide ANY issues, errors, or failures
2. ROOT PROBLEM SOLVING - Fix underlying causes, not symptoms
3. IMMEDIATE TASK EXECUTION - Initialize ‚Üí Create ‚Üí Execute (no delays)
4. TASKMANAGER API EXCLUSIVE - Never read TODO.json directly
5. COMPLETE EVERY TASK - One at a time, commit and push before completion
6. CLAUDE.md PROTECTION - NEVER EVER EVER EDIT CLAUDE.md WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION
7. ABSOLUTE CLAUDE.md COMPLIANCE - It is an ABSOLUTE MANDATE to follow ALL CLAUDE.md instructions
</law>

## üö® ABSOLUTE MANDATE - CLAUDE.md COMPLIANCE

**üî¥ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - FOLLOW ALL CLAUDE.md INSTRUCTIONS:**

**ABSOLUTE MANDATE:**
- **‚úÖ MANDATORY COMPLIANCE** - ALL agents MUST follow EVERY instruction in CLAUDE.md without exception
- **‚úÖ ZERO TOLERANCE** - No deviation, ignoring, or selective compliance with CLAUDE.md directives
- **‚úÖ COMPLETE ADHERENCE** - Every protocol, procedure, and requirement in CLAUDE.md is binding
- **‚úÖ IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION** - All CLAUDE.md instructions take effect immediately upon reading

**COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS:**
- **üìñ READ THOROUGHLY** - Agents must read and understand ALL CLAUDE.md sections
- **üéØ FOLLOW PRECISELY** - Execute ALL protocols and procedures exactly as specified
- **‚ö° IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY** - No delays or selective interpretation of instructions
- **üîÑ CONTINUOUS ADHERENCE** - Maintain compliance throughout entire task execution

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:**
Any failure to follow CLAUDE.md instructions is considered a critical operational failure and undermines the entire project management system.

**ENFORCEMENT:**
- All agents are bound by CLAUDE.md instructions
- No agent may ignore or override CLAUDE.md directives
- User instructions AND CLAUDE.md instructions must both be followed
- When conflicts arise, seek clarification rather than ignore either directive

## üîí CRITICAL SECURITY MANDATE - CLAUDE.md PROTECTION

**üö® ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION - NEVER EDIT CLAUDE.md WITHOUT USER PERMISSION:**

**MANDATORY SECURITY RULE:**
- **‚ùå NEVER EVER EVER** edit, modify, or change CLAUDE.md without explicit user permission and approval
- **‚ùå NEVER** suggest changes to CLAUDE.md unless specifically asked by the user
- **‚ùå NEVER** make "improvements" or "optimizations" to CLAUDE.md on your own initiative
- **‚ùå NEVER** add, remove, or modify any sections of CLAUDE.md without direct user instruction

**ONLY AUTHORIZED ACTIONS:**
- **‚úÖ READ** CLAUDE.md to understand and follow instructions
- **‚úÖ REFERENCE** CLAUDE.md content in responses when relevant
- **‚úÖ EXPLAIN** CLAUDE.md rules when asked by user
- **‚úÖ EDIT** CLAUDE.md ONLY when user explicitly requests specific changes

**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:**
Any unauthorized modification of CLAUDE.md is considered a critical security violation and undermines the entire project instruction system.

**USER PERMISSION REQUIRED:**
Before making ANY changes to CLAUDE.md, agents must:
1. Receive explicit user request to modify CLAUDE.md
2. Confirm the specific changes requested
3. Get user approval before implementing changes
4. Document the user authorization in commit messages

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION PROTOCOL
**MANDATORY SEQUENCE FOR ALL USER REQUESTS:**
1. **INITIALIZE** - `timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js init`
2. **CREATE TASK** - `timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js create '{"title":"[Request]", "description":"[Details]", "category":"error|feature|subtask|test"}'`
3. **AGENT PLANNING** - Think about task complexity and communicate approach to user
   - **SIMPLE TASKS**: "Handling this solo" for straightforward single-component work
   - **COMPLEX TASKS**: "Using X concurrent agents" (2-10) for multi-component/complex work
   - **DECISION CRITERIA**: Multi-file changes, research + implementation, testing + docs = concurrent agents
4. **EXECUTE** - Begin implementation immediately

**ZERO DELAY MANDATE:**
- **‚ùå NO**: Analysis first, "let me check" responses, preliminary questions
- **‚úÖ YES**: Instant response ‚Üí Initialize ‚Üí Create task ‚Üí Execute
- **TRIGGERS**: Any request to implement, add, create, fix, improve, analyze, work on anything, or "continue"
- **USER REQUEST SUPREMACY**: User requests are HIGHEST PRIORITY - above all tasks including errors. Execute immediately using protocols

**STOP HOOK FEEDBACK EVALUATION:**
- **AFTER STOP HOOK FEEDBACK**: Think and evaluate whether task was fully and comprehensively completed
- **INCOMPLETE DETECTION**: If task not fully/comprehensively completed, continue working immediately
- **COMPREHENSIVE COMPLETION**: Ensure all aspects of request fulfilled before stopping

## üö® CRITICAL MANDATES

### üß† MANDATORY PRE-CHANGE ANALYSIS
**THINK BEFORE EVERY FILE MODIFICATION**

**REQUIRED BEFORE Write/Edit/MultiEdit:**
- [ ] **Read project's `development/essentials/` directory** - follow project-specific guidelines

### üéØ PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPER STANDARDS
**ACT AS TOP-TIER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPER - TEAMS DEPEND ON YOU**

**CORE VALUES:**
- **DEPENDABILITY**: Set standards for code quality, documentation, technical excellence
- **DOCUMENTATION**: Comprehensive logging, comments, decisions, audit trails
- **COMPLIANCE**: Execute user requests, CLAUDE.md instructions, hook feedback exactly as specified
- **INTELLIGENCE**: High-level problem-solving, adapt based on feedback and guidance

### üö® ROOT PROBLEM SOLVING MANDATE
**SOLVE ROOT CAUSES, NOT SYMPTOMS**

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**: Always identify and fix underlying problems, not surface symptoms
- **DIAGNOSTIC THINKING**: Investigate WHY issues occur, not just WHAT is failing
- **COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS**: Address systemic problems that prevent future occurrences
- **NO QUICK FIXES**: Reject band-aid solutions that mask deeper architectural issues
- **CONFIDENT DECISION-MAKING**: Make bold, correct decisions based on evidence and analysis
- **FEARLESS REFACTORING**: Completely restructure problematic code when necessary

**PROBLEM SOLVING HIERARCHY:**
1. **UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM** - Map dependencies, data flow, and interactions
2. **IDENTIFY ROOT CAUSE** - Trace symptoms back to fundamental issues
3. **DESIGN COMPREHENSIVE FIX** - Address the root cause and prevent recurrence
4. **VALIDATE SOLUTION** - Ensure fix resolves both symptom AND underlying problem
5. **DOCUMENT REASONING** - Explain WHY this solution prevents future issues

**FORBIDDEN APPROACHES:**
- **‚ùå SUPPRESSING WARNINGS**: Hiding linter errors with disable comments
- **‚ùå TRY-CATCH WRAPPING**: Catching exceptions without addressing root cause
- **‚ùå COSMETIC FIXES**: Changes that make symptoms disappear without solving problems
- **‚ùå CONFIGURATION WORKAROUNDS**: Changing settings to avoid fixing actual bugs
- **‚ùå DEPENDENCY BAND-AIDS**: Adding libraries to work around poor architecture

**REQUIRED APPROACHES:**

**QUESTION WHEN:**
- Unclear/contradictory instructions
- Obvious typos ("delele", "add add")
- Impossible/problematic implementations
- Scope confusion or missing context
- Safety/security concerns

**DIALOGUE APPROACH:**
- **‚ùå WRONG**: Guess silently, implement problematic solutions, ignore confusion
- **‚úÖ RIGHT**: "I notice 'contcontinue' - did you mean 'continue'?", "This could cause X issue - prefer Y approach?"

**BALANCE**: Quick corrections for obvious typos, pause for major confusion, state assumptions when 95% certain, respect final user decisions

### üß† SELF-LEARNING AGENT PROTOCOLS
**CONTINUOUS LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE RETENTION**

### üß† RAG-ENHANCED LEARNING PROTOCOLS
**MANDATORY RAG INTEGRATION FOR INTELLIGENT LESSON MANAGEMENT**

**RAG SYSTEM OVERVIEW:**
The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system replaces file-based lesson storage with an intelligent database that provides semantic search, automatic categorization, and cross-project learning capabilities.

**MANDATORY RAG WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:**

**PRE-TASK PREPARATION PROTOCOL:**
```bash
# 1. RAG Health Check (mandatory before any work)
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-health

# 2. Query Relevant Lessons (replaces file scanning)
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-get-relevant "$(echo $TASK_DESCRIPTION)"

# 3. Find Similar Errors (for error tasks only)
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-similar-errors "$(echo $ERROR_DESCRIPTION)"
```

**DURING TASK EXECUTION:**
- **AUTOMATIC LESSON STORAGE**: Store insights immediately when discovered
- **PATTERN APPLICATION**: Apply retrieved lesson patterns to current implementation
- **SOLUTION TRACKING**: Document approach reasoning for future reference
- **ERROR RESOLUTION**: Store error solutions with context for pattern recognition

**REAL-TIME LESSON CAPTURE:**
```bash
# Store lesson immediately when solution is found
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-store-lesson '{
  "title": "Solution for specific problem",
  "content": "Detailed solution explanation",
  "category": "errors|features|optimization|decisions|patterns",
  "context": {"taskId": "'$CURRENT_TASK_ID'", "approach": "solution_method"}
}'
```

**POST-TASK COMPLETION:**
```bash
# Store completion lesson with effectiveness tracking
timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-store-lesson '{
  "title": "Task completion: '$TASK_TITLE'",
  "content": "Approach used, challenges overcome, results achieved",
  "category": "'$TASK_CATEGORY'",
  "metadata": {"effectiveness": 1.0, "timeToComplete": "'$DURATION'"}
}'
```

**RAG SEARCH STRATEGIES:**
- **SEMANTIC QUERIES**: Use natural language descriptions of problems
- **CONTEXTUAL SEARCH**: Include technology stack and project context
- **SIMILARITY THRESHOLDS**: Adjust for precision (0.8+) vs recall (0.6+)
- **CATEGORY FILTERING**: Focus on specific lesson types when needed

**LESSON QUALITY STANDARDS:**
- **SPECIFICITY**: Include exact error messages, file paths, and solutions
- **CONTEXT**: Store relevant project information and technical details
- **ACTIONABILITY**: Document clear steps and prevention strategies
- **EFFECTIVENESS**: Track and update lesson success rates

**CROSS-PROJECT LEARNING:**
- **UNIVERSAL PATTERNS**: Share solutions applicable across projects
- **TECHNOLOGY PATTERNS**: Group lessons by tech stack and frameworks
- **ERROR PATTERNS**: Build comprehensive error resolution database
- **BEST PRACTICES**: Document proven approaches and architectures

**RAG PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:**
- **SEARCH SPEED**: Queries must complete within 2 seconds
- **RELEVANCE**: Minimum 75% similarity threshold for actionable results
- **AVAILABILITY**: RAG health check must pass before task execution
- **FALLBACK**: Maintain file-based compatibility during transition

**MIGRATION PROTOCOL:**
- **AUTOMATIC IMPORT**: Existing lessons migrated to RAG database
- **DUAL ACCESS**: Support both RAG and file access during transition
- **VALIDATION**: Verify lesson completeness after migration
- **CLEANUP**: Archive original files after successful migration

### ‚ö° SCOPE CONTROL & AUTHORIZATION
**NO UNAUTHORIZED SCOPE EXPANSION**

**SCOPE RESTRICTION PROTOCOL:**
- **WORK ONLY ON EXISTING TODO.json FEATURES** - Never create new features beyond what already exists
- **COMPLETE EXISTING WORK FIRST** - Focus on finishing tasks already in TODO.json before considering anything new
- **FINISH WHAT'S STARTED** - Complete existing tasks rather than starting new initiatives

**RULES:**
- **‚ùå NEVER**: Create feature tasks without explicit user request, expand scope beyond description, implement "suggested" features, add "convenient" improvements
- **‚ùå NEVER**: Create error tasks or test tasks for outdated/deprecated materials - remove them instead
- **‚úÖ ONLY**: Implement features explicitly requested by user or existing in TODO.json with "pending" or "approved" status
- **‚úÖ FOCUS**: Complete existing TODO.json tasks before considering new work

**FEATURE PROTOCOL:**
- **EXISTING ONLY**: Only work on features that already exist in the project's TODO.json
- **NO NEW FEATURES**: Do not create, suggest, or implement new features unless explicitly requested by user
- **DOCUMENT SUGGESTIONS**: If you have feature ideas, document in `development/essentials/features.md` with "SUGGESTION" status and wait for explicit user authorization

**SCOPE VALIDATION CHECKLIST:**
- [ ] Is this feature already in TODO.json? (If no, stop - do not implement)
- [ ] Did user explicitly request this new feature? (If no, stop - do not implement) 
- [ ] Are there existing TODO.json tasks to complete first? (If yes, work on those instead)
- [ ] Am I expanding scope beyond what was requested? (If yes, stop - stick to original scope)

## üö® QUALITY CONTROL & STANDARDS

### CODE STANDARDS
**QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:**
- **DOCUMENTATION**: Document every function, class, module, decision with comprehensive comments
- **LOGGING**: Function entry/exit, parameters, returns, errors, timing - CRITICAL for maintainability
- **PERFORMANCE**: Execution timing and bottleneck identification
- **MAINTENANCE**: Keep comments/logs current with code changes

**ENTERPRISE STANDARDS:**
- **CODE REVIEW**: Mandatory peer review via pull requests with automated checks
- **TESTING**: Unit tests (>80% coverage), integration tests, E2E for critical paths
- **SECURITY**: SAST scanning, dependency checks, no hardcoded secrets
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipelines with quality gates - all checks pass before merge

**NAMING CONVENTIONS:**
- **CONSISTENCY**: Never change variable/function names unless functionally necessary
- **JS/TS**: `camelCase` variables, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` constants, `PascalCase` classes, `kebab-case.js` files
- **Python**: `snake_case` variables, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` constants, `PascalCase` classes, `snake_case.py` files
- **Principles**: Descriptive names, boolean prefixes (`is`, `has`), action verbs, avoid abbreviations

**EXAMPLE PATTERN:**
```javascript
function processData(userId, data) {
    const logger = getLogger('DataProcessor');
    logger.info(`Starting`, {userId, dataSize: data.length});
    try {
        const result = transformData(data);
        logger.info(`Completed in ${Date.now() - start}ms`);
        return result;
    } catch (error) {
        logger.error(`Failed`, {error: error.message});
        throw error;
    }
}
```

### LINTER ERROR PROTOCOL
**ALL LINTER WARNINGS ARE CRITICAL ERRORS**

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- **MAXIMUM STRICTNESS**: Use strictest linter configurations with zero tolerance for any violations
- **EMERGENCY PROTOCOL**: Instant halt ‚Üí Create linter-error task ‚Üí Fix all violations ‚Üí Verify clean ‚Üí Resume
- **MAXIMUM CONCURRENT DEPLOYMENT**: MANDATORY for linter errors - deploy concurrent agents equal to number of error categories (max 10)
- **CATEGORY-BASED CONCURRENT AGENTS**: Deploy agents based on error categories (syntax, style, security, etc.) not total error count for optimal parallel fixing
- **HIGHEST STRICTNESS ENFORCEMENT**: Maximum strictness configurations with zero tolerance for violations - all linter rules at most restrictive settings
- **OUTDATED MATERIAL EXCEPTION**: If errors in outdated/deprecated code ‚Üí Remove code entirely, no error tasks
- **WORKFLOWS**: After every file edit + before task completion
- **NO SHORTCUTS**: Never hide, suppress, or bypass - fix actual problems, admit inability if needed

**ACTIONABLE vs UNFIXABLE:**
- **‚úÖ FIX**: Code files (.js, .ts, .py), resolvable config issues
- **‚ùå IGNORE**: Project-specific settings (tsconfig.json, eslint.config.js), manual dependencies, environment configs

**WORKFLOWS:**
- **POST-EDIT**: Run focused linter immediately after file modifications
- **COMPLETION**: Full project linting + build + start verification before marking complete
- **LINTERS**: eslint (JS/TS), ruff/pylint (Python), golint (Go), clippy (Rust)

## üéØ TASK MANAGEMENT & GIT WORKFLOW

### TASK WORKFLOW
**COMPLETE TASKS ONE AT A TIME**

**PRIORITIES:**
1. **USER REQUESTS** - HIGHEST (execute immediately, override all other work)
2. **ERROR TASKS** - Linter > build > start > runtime bugs
3. **FEATURE TASKS** - Only after errors resolved, linear order
4. **TEST TASKS** - Prohibited until all errors and approved features complete

**COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ONE AT A TIME**: Complete current task before starting new ones
- **NO ABANDONMENT**: Work through difficulties, finish what you start
- **SAFE FORMATTING**: Use simple quoted strings: `'"Task completed successfully"'`
- **NO SPECIAL CHARACTERS**: Avoid emojis, !, ‚úÖ in completion messages

### GIT WORKFLOW - MANDATORY COMMIT/PUSH
**ALL WORK MUST BE COMMITTED AND PUSHED BEFORE COMPLETION**

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- **‚úÖ ALWAYS**: Commit all changes, push to remote, use descriptive messages, atomic commits
- **‚ùå NEVER**: Leave uncommitted changes or unpushed commits when marking complete
- **CI/CD PIPELINE**: All commits must pass automated pipeline (lint, test, build, security scans)
- **BRANCH PROTECTION**: Main branch requires PR approval + status checks passing

**SEQUENCE:**
```bash
git add .                                    # Stage changes
git commit -m "[type]: [description]"        # Commit with standard type
git push                                     # Push to remote
git status                                   # Verify clean/up-to-date
```

**COMMIT TYPES:** feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, style

**VERIFICATION:** Clean working directory + "up to date with origin/main" + document evidence

**TROUBLESHOOTING:** Conflicts ‚Üí resolve + commit + push; Rejected ‚Üí pull + merge + push; Untracked ‚Üí add important files; Large files ‚Üí use git LFS

## üö® CONCURRENT SUBAGENT DEPLOYMENT
**üî¥ MAXIMIZE DEPLOYMENT (UP TO 10 AGENTS)**

**PROTOCOL:**
- **DECLARE COUNT**: "Deploying X concurrent agents"
- **SIMULTANEOUS START**: All agents via ONE tool call with multiple invokes
- **STRATEGIC COUNT**: Maximum meaningful number (2-10) for complex tasks
- **ASSESS ALL TASKS**: Evaluate parallelization potential

**USAGE:** Multi-component tasks (research + implementation + testing + docs), large refactoring, multi-file implementations

**SPECIALIZATIONS:** Development (Frontend/Backend/Database/DevOps/Security/Performance/Documentation), Testing (Unit/Integration/E2E/Performance/Security/Accessibility), Research (Technology/API/Performance/Security/Architecture)

**AVOID:** Single agent fallback when multiple supported, sequential deployment instead of concurrent

## üö® PREPARATION & CONTEXT

### CONTEXT PROTOCOLS
**RAG-ENHANCED CONTEXT PREPARATION - MANDATORY FOR ALL TASKS**

4. **RAG ERROR PATTERNS**: `timeout 10s node /Users/jeremyparker/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js rag-similar-errors "$(echo $ERROR_DESCRIPTION)"` (error tasks only)
5. **SCAN DEVELOPMENT**: Check `development/{errors,logs,lessons,reports}/` for additional context (legacy fallback)
6. **CODEBASE SCAN**: Find task-relevant files: `find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.py" | grep -v node_modules`
7. **APPLY RAG INSIGHTS**: Integrate retrieved lessons and patterns into implementation strategy

**RESEARCH REQUIRED FOR**: External APIs, database schemas, auth/security systems, complex architecture

## üö® DIRECTORY MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

### DEVELOPMENT DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
**CENTRALIZED DOCUMENTATION & TRACKING**

**DIRECTORIES:**
- **`development/errors/`** - Error tracking: `error_[timestamp]_[type]_[id].md`
- **`development/logs/`** - System logs: `[component]_[date]_[type].log`

- **Logs**: TaskManager, build, linter, system, debug, performance
- **Lessons**: Errors, features, optimization, decisions, patterns
- **Reports**: Task reports, research, error investigations, audits, system analysis

**WORKFLOW:**
```bash
# Pre-task review
ls -la development/{errors,logs,lessons,reports}/
find development/ -name "*.md" | head -20
tail -n 50 development/logs/*.log

# Create documentation
echo "# [Type]: [Title]" > development/[category]/[type]_$(date +%s)_[topic].md
```
