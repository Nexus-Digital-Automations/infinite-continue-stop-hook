## 🚨 CRITICAL MANDATES

### ⚡ INSTANT TASK CREATION PROTOCOL - ABSOLUTE MANDATE
**🔴 CRITICAL: IMMEDIATELY CREATE TASK FOR ANY USER REQUEST OR DETECTED OPPORTUNITY**

**INSTANT CREATION REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **CREATE TASK INSTANTLY** - Use TaskManager API before any other action
2. **CATEGORY MANDATORY** - Specify: linter-error, missing-feature, bug, enhancement, research, etc.
3. **ZERO DELAY TOLERANCE** - No thinking, analysis, or preparation first
4. **THEN EXECUTE** - Only after task creation can work begin

**INSTANT CREATION TRIGGERS:**
- User requests/instructions
- Linter errors (highest priority)

    const operationId = generateOperationId();
    
    logger.info(`[${operationId}] Starting data processing`, {
        userId, operationId, dataSize: JSON.stringify(data).length
    });
    
    try {
        const startTime = Date.now();
        const result = transformData(data);
        const processingTime = Date.now() - startTime;
        
        logger.info(`[${operationId}] Processing completed`, {
            userId, operationId, processingTimeMs: processingTime
        });
        return result;
    } catch (error) {

 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Processed and validated data object
 * @throws {ValidationError} When data fails validation checks
 */
function processData(userId, data) {
    // Generate unique operation ID for tracking this processing request
    const logger = getLogger('DataProcessor');
    const operationId = generateOperationId();
    
    // Log processing start with context for debugging
    logger.info(`[${operationId}] Starting data processing`, {
        userId, operationId, dataSize: JSON.stringify(data).length
    });
    
    try {
        // Track processing time for performance monitoring
        const startTime = Date.now();
        
        // Apply transformation rules - see transformData() for business logic
        const result = transformData(data);
        const processingTime = Date.now() - startTime;
        
        // Log successful completion with performance metrics
        logger.info(`[${operationId}] Processing completed`, {
            userId, operationId, processingTimeMs: processingTime
        });
        return result;
    } catch (error) {
        // Log failure with full context for debugging
        logger.error(`[${operationId}] Processing failed`, {
            userId, operationId, error: error.message, stack: error.stack
        });
        throw error; // Re-throw to maintain error propagation
    }
}
```

- **PERFECT AWARENESS** - Demonstrate complete understanding of all feedback received

### 🔄 **MANDATORY AGENT REINITIALIZATION PROTOCOL**
**🚨 ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: REINITIALIZE AGENT AFTER EVERY TASK AND STOP HOOK**

**AGENT REINITIALIZATION MANDATE:**
- **✅ AFTER EVERY TASK COMPLETION** - Reinitialize agent to renew heartbeat and prevent expiration
- **✅ AFTER EVERY STOP HOOK** - Reinitialize agent immediately when receiving stop hook feedback
- **✅ PREVENTS AGENT EXPIRATION** - Keeps agent alive and prevents timeout-related failures
- **✅ RESETS AGENT TIMEOUT** - Extends agent lifecycle and maintains active status
- **✅ RENEWS HEARTBEAT** - Updates agent heartbeat to current time
- **❌ NEVER SKIP REINITIALIZATION** - Required for maintaining agent availability

**REINITIALIZATION API ENDPOINT:**
```bash
# 🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS INITIALIZE FIRST IF NO AGENT EXISTS
# Step 1: Initialize agent if not already done
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" init --project "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook"

# Step 2: Then reinitialize the agent (this will auto-detect agent ID)
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" reinitialize

# Alternative: Reinitialize specific agent with config
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" reinitialize AGENT_ID '{"metadata": {"renewed": true}}'
```

**MANDATORY REINITIALIZATION TRIGGERS:**
1. **Task Completion** - Always reinitialize after marking any task as completed
2. **Stop Hook Feedback** - Always reinitialize when receiving stop hook feedback
3. **Before Long Operations** - Reinitialize before starting time-intensive work
4. **After Idle Periods** - Reinitialize if agent has been inactive

**REINITIALIZATION WORKFLOW:**
1. **Complete current work** (if any)
2. **Check if agent exists** - If reinitialize fails with "No agent ID", run init first
3. **Run initialization if needed** - `taskmanager-api.js init --project [path]`
4. **Run reinitialization command** - Use TaskManager API reinitialize endpoint
5. **Verify renewal success** - Check that agent status shows renewed heartbeat
6. **Continue with next task** - Proceed with normal workflow

**🚨 CRITICAL AGENT INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE:**
```bash
# ALWAYS use this sequence when starting fresh or getting "No agent ID" errors:

# 1. Initialize agent (creates new agent if none exists)
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" init --project "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook"

# 2. Immediately reinitialize to refresh heartbeat
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" reinitialize

# 3. Check current tasks
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" list '{"status": "pending"}'
```

**🔴 ERROR HANDLING FOR REINITIALIZATION:**
- **"No agent ID provided"** → Run init first, then reinitialize
- **"No agent initialized"** → Run init first, then reinitialize  
- **Reinitialize fails** → Always try init then reinitialize sequence
- **Never skip this step** → Agent expiration leads to task system failures

**🔄 STOP HOOK REINITIALIZATION:**
- **IMMEDIATELY REINITIALIZE** when receiving any stop hook feedback
- **RENEW AGENT BEFORE** responding to stop hook instructions
- **MAINTAIN AGENT AVAILABILITY** for continued task execution
- **PREVENT EXPIRATION** during stop hook processing

## 🚨 ERROR HANDLING & QUALITY PROTOCOLS


### 🚨 **LINTER ERROR PROTOCOL - SUPREME PRIORITY**
**🔴 LINTER ERRORS = HIGHEST PRIORITY - DROP EVERYTHING TO FIX IMMEDIATELY**

### 🚨 **EMERGENCY LINTER ERROR DROP-EVERYTHING PROTOCOL**
**⚡ INSTANT EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO ANY LINTER ERROR FROM ANY SOURCE ⚡**

**🔴 ABSOLUTE EMERGENCY TRIGGERS:**
- **❌ LINTER ERRORS IN FILES** - Any syntax, formatting, or code quality errors detected
- **❌ LINTER ERRORS FROM HOOK FEEDBACK** - Stop hook or any hook reporting linter failures
- **❌ LINTER ERRORS FROM COMMANDS** - Any command execution showing linting failures
- **❌ LINTER ERRORS FROM VALIDATION** - Post-edit checks revealing code issues

**🚨 EMERGENCY DROP-EVERYTHING PROTOCOL:**
1. **⚡ INSTANT HALT** - Stop ALL current work immediately, no exceptions
2. **🔴 CREATE EMERGENCY TASK** - Immediately create linter-error task with highest priority
3. **🛑 ABANDON CURRENT WORK** - Put everything on hold until linter errors resolved
4. **⚠️ EMERGENCY MODE** - Enter emergency linter-fixing mode with singular focus
5. **🔧 FIX ALL ERRORS** - Address every single linting violation found
6. **✅ VERIFY CLEAN** - Re-run linters to confirm all errors eliminated
7. **🎯 ONLY THEN RESUME** - Return to previous work only after linting is perfect

**🚨 HOOK FEEDBACK LINTER EMERGENCY:**
- **STOP HOOK REPORTS LINTER ERRORS** → **EMERGENCY DROP-EVERYTHING MODE**
- **ANY HOOK MENTIONS LINTING** → **IMMEDIATE HALT AND FIX**
- **HOOK SAYS "LINTER FAILED"** → **ABANDON ALL WORK AND FIX**
- **HOOK SHOWS SYNTAX ERRORS** → **EMERGENCY LINTER PROTOCOL**

**MANDATORY LINTER WORKFLOW:**
1. **DETECT linter error** → **INSTANTLY CREATE linter-error task**
2. **DROP ALL OTHER WORK** → Fix linter errors immediately  
3. **Run validation**: npm run lint, npm run typecheck, etc.
4. **Fix any errors found** - never ignore or suppress
5. **Re-run linter to verify fixes**
6. **ONLY THEN continue other work**

**🔴 MANDATORY FOCUSED LINTER CHECK AFTER EVERY FILE OPERATION:**
**🚨 ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: RUN FOCUSED LINTER ON MODIFIED FILES/FOLDERS - NO EXCEPTIONS**

- **✅ AFTER EVERY EDIT** - Run focused linter check on edited file and its parent folder immediately
- **✅ AFTER EVERY WRITE** - Run focused linter check on new file and its parent folder immediately  
- **✅ LANGUAGE AGNOSTIC** - Use appropriate linter for each language (eslint, ruff, black, pylint, etc.)
- **✅ FOCUSED SCOPE** - Only check the specific files/folders being worked on, not entire project
- **✅ IMMEDIATE DETECTION** - Catch linter errors the instant they are introduced
- **✅ FIX INSTANTLY** - If linting fails, create linter-error task and fix immediately
- **❌ NO EXCEPTIONS** - This applies to ALL file modifications, no matter how small
- **❌ NO DELAYS** - Focused linter checks must happen immediately after file operations

**POST-EDIT FOCUSED LINTER CHECK SEQUENCE:**
1. **Edit or write any file**
2. **IMMEDIATELY run focused linter on**:
   - **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `eslint [file/folder]`
   - **Python**: `ruff check [file/folder]` or `pylint [file/folder]`
   - **Go**: `golint [file/folder]` or `go vet [file/folder]`
   - **Rust**: `clippy [file/folder]`
   - **Other languages**: Use appropriate language-specific linter
3. **IF errors found** → Create linter-error task INSTANTLY and fix
4. **IF clean** → Continue with next operation
5. **NEVER skip this step** - mandatory for every file operation

**TASK COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS (PROJECT-WIDE VALIDATION):**
- **ALWAYS run full project linter checks** before marking any task complete (npm run lint, ruff ., etc.)
- **ALWAYS run build verification** - ensure project still builds successfully (npm run build, pnpm run build, cargo build, etc.)
- **ALWAYS run start verification** - ensure project still starts successfully 
  - **Use timeout for dev commands**: `timeout 30s npm run dev`, `timeout 30s pnpm run dev`
  - **Standard start commands**: `npm start`, `pnpm start`, `python main.py`, `cargo run`, `./executable`
- **ALWAYS fix all errors** before completion
- **ALWAYS provide validation evidence** showing clean results across entire project
- If project-wide linting fails → Create new linter-error task IMMEDIATELY
- If build fails → Create new build-error task IMMEDIATELY
- If start fails → Create new start-error task IMMEDIATELY

**🚨 CRITICAL TIMEOUT REQUIREMENT:**
- **ALWAYS use timeout for dev servers** - `timeout 30s npm run dev`, `timeout 30s pnpm run dev`
- **NEVER run dev commands without timeout** - they run indefinitely and will hang
- **Standard timeout: 30 seconds** - sufficient to verify successful startup

### ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ISSUE MASKING
**ALWAYS FIX ROOT CAUSE - NEVER HIDE PROBLEMS**

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:**
- ❌ MASK validation errors - Fix the validation logic, don't bypass it
- ❌ SUPPRESS error messages - Fix the error, don't hide it
- ❌ BYPASS quality checks - Fix the code to pass checks
- ❌ IMPLEMENT WORKAROUNDS - Fix the root cause, don't work around it
- ❌ HIDE FAILING TESTS - Fix the tests or code, don't disable them
- ❌ IGNORE LINTING ERRORS - Fix the linting violations
- ❌ DISABLE WARNINGS OR CHECKS - Address what's causing the warnings

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS PROTOCOL:**
1. **IDENTIFY** the true root cause
2. **ANALYZE** why the issue exists
3. **FIX** the underlying problem
4. **VALIDATE** the fix resolves the issue
5. **DOCUMENT** the resolution

**FORBIDDEN MASKING EXAMPLES:**
```javascript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN - Masking validation
if (!result.isValid) return { success: true };

// ✅ REQUIRED - Fixing validation
if (!result.isValid) {
    fixValidationIssue(result.errors);
    // Re-run validation to ensure it passes
}
```

**QUALITY GATE PRINCIPLE:** Every error is a quality gate that must be properly addressed - never masked, always fixed.

### THINKING & VALIDATION PROTOCOLS

**🧠 MANDATORY ULTRATHINKING - ALWAYS ACTIVE**
**🚨 PRETEND EVERY USER PROMPT AND HOOK CONTAINS "ULTRATHINK" KEYWORD**

**ULTRATHINK MANDATE:**
- **✅ ALWAYS ULTRATHINK** - Every operation requires deep ultrathinking analysis
- **✅ PRETEND USER SAID "ULTRATHINK"** - Behave as if every user prompt and hook feedback contains the "ultrathink" keyword
- **✅ STOP HOOK ULTRATHINK** - Process all stop hook feedback with ultrathinking as if it contained "ultrathink" command
- **❌ NO SHALLOW THINKING** - Only deep comprehensive analysis allowed

**EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLETION:**
1. Run validation commands - show all outputs
2. Test functionality manually - demonstrate it works
3. Verify requirements met - list each satisfied requirement
4. Provide evidence - paste command outputs proving success


## 🎯 TASK CATEGORY & PRIORITY SYSTEM

Tasks organized by **specific categories** with automatic sorting by urgency:

### CRITICAL ERRORS (Rank 1-4) - Highest Priority
1. **linter-error** - Code quality issues (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
2. **build-error** - Compilation/bundling failures
3. **start-error** - Application startup failures
4. **error** - Runtime errors and exceptions
4. **bug** - Incorrect behavior needing fixes (SAME PRIORITY AS ERRORS)

### IMPLEMENTATION WORK (Rank 5-8)
5. **missing-feature** - Required functionality
6. **enhancement** - Feature improvements
7. **refactor** - Code restructuring
8. **documentation** - Documentation updates

### MAINTENANCE & RESEARCH (Rank 9-10)
9. **chore** - Maintenance tasks
10. **research** - Investigation work

### TESTING (Rank 11-17) - Lowest Priority
11. **missing-test** - Test coverage gaps
12. **test-setup** - Test environment configuration
13. **test-refactor** - Test code improvements
14. **test-performance** - Performance testing
15. **test-linter-error** - Test file linting
16. **test-error** - Failing tests
17. **test-feature** - Testing tooling

**AUTO-SORTING:** Category Rank → Priority Value → Creation Time

**TASK CREATION COMMANDS:**
```bash
# CRITICAL: ALWAYS USE SINGLE QUOTES to avoid bash escaping errors

# Linter error (highest priority)
node -e 'const TaskManager = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); const tm = new TaskManager("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json"); tm.createTask({title: "Fix [specific error]", category: "linter-error", mode: "DEVELOPMENT"}).then(id => console.log("Created:", id));'

# Feature implementation
node -e 'const TaskManager = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); const tm = new TaskManager("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json"); tm.createTask({title: "Implement [feature]", category: "missing-feature", mode: "DEVELOPMENT"}).then(id => console.log("Created:", id));'

# Research task
node -e 'const TaskManager = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); const tm = new TaskManager("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json"); tm.createTask({title: "Research [topic]", category: "research", mode: "DEVELOPMENT"}).then(id => console.log("Created:", id));'
```

## 🚨 TASK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS

**ALWAYS CREATE TASKS FOR:**
- Every user request/instruction
- All detected errors (linting, runtime, build, test failures)
- Performance issues and security vulnerabilities
- Code quality opportunities and missing functionality
- Integration issues and improvement opportunities

**WORKFLOW:** User request → Create task → Check existing → Execute


## 🚨 BASH ESCAPING PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL RULE: ALWAYS USE SINGLE QUOTES FOR NODE -E COMMANDS**

**Common Errors:** SyntaxError from improper quote escaping, shell interference with JavaScript

**CORRECT PATTERNS:**
```bash
# ✅ Single quotes for shell, double quotes for JavaScript
node -e 'const tm = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); tm.createTask({title: "Task"});'

# ❌ FORBIDDEN - Double quotes for outer shell
node -e "const tm = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager');"
```

**Troubleshooting:** Switch to single quotes, use double quotes inside JavaScript, create temp file for complex commands

## 🚨 CONCURRENT TASK SUBAGENT DEPLOYMENT

**🔴 ABSOLUTE MANDATE: MAXIMIZE CONCURRENT SIMULTANEOUS DEPLOYMENT AT ALL TIMES**

**🚨 CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ENFORCEMENT:**
Deploy as many concurrent task subagents simultaneously as appropriate (up to 10 maximum) whenever tasks have ANY parallelizable components. This is an ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT, not a suggestion.

**CONCURRENT DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **✅ SIMULTANEOUS START** - All agents MUST begin AT THE EXACT SAME TIME
- **✅ MAXIMIZE PARALLELIZATION** - Break work into parallel streams aggressively
- **✅ APPROPRIATE SCALING** - Use the MAXIMUM number of agents task meaningfully supports
- **✅ MANDATORY ASSESSMENT** - Every task must be evaluated for concurrent deployment potential
- **❌ NEVER SEQUENTIAL** - Multiple agents running one after another STRICTLY FORBIDDEN unless dependency chain exists
- **❌ NO SINGLE-AGENT BIAS** - Do not default to single agent when multiple agents could work in parallel

**MANDATORY CONCURRENT USAGE FOR:**
- **✅ Complex multi-component tasks** - Research, implementation, testing, documentation MUST run in parallel
- **✅ Large scale refactoring** - Multiple files/modules MUST be handled simultaneously
- **✅ Comprehensive analysis** - Different aspects MUST be analyzed concurrently
- **✅ Multi-file implementations** - Any work touching multiple files MUST use parallel agents
- **✅ Research + Implementation** - Research and implementation tasks MUST run concurrently when possible
- **✅ Testing workflows** - Unit, integration, and E2E tests MUST run in parallel

**SINGLE-AGENT EXCEPTIONS (VERY LIMITED):**
- **❌ Simple single-file edits** - Only when truly isolated and cannot be parallelized
- **❌ Trivial operations** - Basic validation, simple queries with no expansion potential

**SPECIALIZATIONS BY MODE:**
- **DEVELOPMENT**: Frontend, Backend, Database, DevOps, Security, Performance, Documentation
- **TESTING**: Unit Test, Integration Test, E2E Test, Performance Test, Security Test, Accessibility Test
- **RESEARCH**: Technology Evaluator, API Analyst, Performance Researcher, Security Auditor, Architecture Analyst
- **DEBUGGING**: Error Analysis, Performance Profiling, Security Audit, Code Quality, Dependency Analysis

**DEPLOYMENT PATTERN:** Think → Assess Parallelization Potential → Deploy MAXIMUM Concurrent Agents → Monitor → Synchronize Completion

**🚨 CONCURRENT DEPLOYMENT MANDATE:**
- **ALWAYS DEFAULT TO CONCURRENT** - When in doubt, use multiple agents
- **AGGRESSIVE PARALLELIZATION** - Break tasks down to enable maximum concurrency
- **SIMULTANEOUS EXECUTION** - All agents start together, no sequential delays
- **COORDINATION PROTOCOLS** - Ensure agents work in harmony without conflicts


## 🚨 CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

**Always check for ABOUT.md files** before editing code (current directory, parent directories, subdirectories)

## 🚨 DEVELOPMENT ESSENTIALS REVIEW MANDATE

**🔴 ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: ALWAYS READ/REVIEW DEVELOPMENT/ESSENTIALS DIRECTORY**

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL:**
1. **CHECK development/essentials/** - Always check if development/essentials directory exists
2. **READ ALL ESSENTIAL FILES** - Review every file in development/essentials before starting any work
3. **CRITICAL CONTEXT** - Files in development/essentials contain critical project context and requirements
4. **NEVER SKIP** - Never begin implementation without reviewing essentials directory content
5. **UPDATE AWARENESS** - Re-check development/essentials if it gets created during project lifecycle

**ESSENTIAL FILES PRIORITY:**
- **Project-specific constraints** - Technical limitations and requirements
- **Architecture decisions** - Core design patterns and principles  
- **Security requirements** - Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Performance standards** - Optimization requirements and benchmarks
- **Integration specifications** - External service dependencies and protocols
- **Deployment considerations** - Environment-specific configurations

**WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:**
- **Before task execution** - Review development/essentials as first step
- **During planning** - Reference essentials for implementation decisions
- **For complex tasks** - Include essentials review in task dependencies
- **When blocked** - Check essentials for guidance and constraints

**NOTE**: If development/essentials directory doesn't exist, this requirement is dormant until the directory is created.

## 🚨 RESEARCH REPORTS INTEGRATION & DEPENDENCY SYSTEM

**🔴 ABSOLUTE MANDATE: ALWAYS READ RELEVANT RESEARCH REPORTS FIRST**

**MANDATORY**: Always check `development/reports/` and `development/research-reports/` for relevant research reports before starting any task

**CRITICAL PROTOCOL**:
1. **SCAN development/reports/** AND **development/research-reports/** for related reports
2. **ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED**: ADD relevant reports to important_files when creating tasks  
3. **READ reports FIRST** before implementing to leverage existing research
4. **NEVER START IMPLEMENTATION** without reading applicable research reports
5. **INCLUDE REPORTS AS IMPORTANT FILES** in all related TODO.json tasks

**🚨 RESEARCH REPORT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ALWAYS include relevant research reports** in task important_files
- **READ research reports BEFORE implementation** - never skip this step
- **LEVERAGE existing research** to inform implementation decisions
- **REFERENCE research findings** in implementation approach
- **UPDATE research reports** if new findings discovered during implementation

## 🚨 MANDATORY RESEARCH TASK CREATION FOR COMPLEX WORK

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Create research tasks as dependencies for any complex implementation work

**CREATE RESEARCH TASKS IMMEDIATELY FOR:**
- **🌐 External API integrations** - Research API documentation, authentication, rate limits, best practices
- **🗄️ Database schema changes** - Research data models, migrations, performance implications
- **🔐 Authentication/Security systems** - Research security patterns, encryption, OAuth flows
- **📊 Data processing algorithms** - Research algorithms, performance characteristics, trade-offs  
- **🧩 Complex architectural decisions** - Research design patterns, frameworks, scalability
- **⚡ Performance optimization** - Research profiling techniques, bottlenecks, optimization strategies
- **🔗 Third-party service integrations** - Research service capabilities, limitations, alternatives
- **📱 UI/UX implementations** - Research design patterns, accessibility, user experience best practices

**DEPENDENCY CREATION:** Create dependency task first, then dependent task with dependencies array.

**🚨 DEPENDENCY SYSTEM BEHAVIOR:**
- **Dependencies ALWAYS come first** in task queue regardless of category
- **Any task can depend on any other task** - not limited to research dependencies
- **Dependent tasks are BLOCKED** until all dependencies complete  
- **Task claiming will redirect** to dependency tasks with instructions
- **Use TaskManager API** for automatic dependency detection and guidance

## 🚨 CODING STANDARDS

**MANDATORY**: All agents MUST follow the standardized coding conventions defined in the global CLAUDE.md at `/Users/jeremyparker/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

These standards ensure consistency across large codebases and multi-agent collaboration, covering:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Industry standard + TypeScript strict mode
- **Python**: Black + Ruff + mypy strict mode  
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Naming patterns, error handling, logging
- **Configuration Files**: .editorconfig, eslint.config.mjs, pyproject.toml
- **Enforcement Protocol**: Zero-tolerance linting and validation requirements

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Refer to global CLAUDE.md for complete coding standards - this prevents duplication and ensures all projects use identical standards.


## 🚨 PRODUCTION-READY MANDATE

**🔴 ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: ALL CODE AND FEATURES MUST BE PRODUCTION-READY**

**PRODUCTION-READY STANDARDS:**
- **❌ NO SIMPLIFIED VERSIONS** - Never create placeholder or simplified implementations
- **❌ NO MOCK IMPLEMENTATIONS** - All functionality must be fully operational
- **❌ NO TEMPORARY WORKAROUNDS** - Implement proper, sustainable solutions
- **❌ NO PLACEHOLDER CODE** - Every line of code must serve a real purpose
- **✅ ENTERPRISE-GRADE QUALITY** - Code must meet production deployment standards
- **✅ COMPLETE FUNCTIONALITY** - All features must be fully implemented and tested
- **✅ ROBUST ERROR HANDLING** - Comprehensive error management and recovery
- **✅ SCALABLE ARCHITECTURE** - Designed to handle production loads and growth

- **✅ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZED** - Code must perform efficiently under production conditions

## 🚨 ABSOLUTE SETTINGS PROTECTION MANDATE

**🔴 CRITICAL PROHIBITION - NEVER EVER EVER:**
- **❌ NEVER EDIT settings.json** - `/Users/jeremyparker/.claude/settings.json` is ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN to modify
- **❌ NEVER TOUCH GLOBAL SETTINGS** - Any modification to global Claude settings is prohibited
- **❌ NEVER SUGGEST SETTINGS CHANGES** - Do not recommend editing global configuration files
- **❌ NEVER ACCESS SETTINGS FILES** - Avoid reading or writing to any Claude settings files

**GOLDEN RULE:** Global Claude settings at `/Users/jeremyparker/.claude/settings.json` are **UNTOUCHABLE** - treat as read-only system files

## 🚨 WORKFLOW PROTOCOLS

**TODO.json INTERACTION PROTOCOL:**
**MANDATORY**: ALWAYS USE THE TASKMANAGER API WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE TODO.JSON

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: ALL TODO.json operations (read/write) MUST use TaskManager API exclusively.

**✅ ALLOWED**: Reading TODO.json as a file (Read tool only) for viewing/inspection
**✅ CORRECT**: TaskManager API for ALL TODO.json interactions (create, update, delete, modify, reorder)
**❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: Any write operations directly to TODO.json file
**❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: fs.readFileSync/writeFileSync on TODO.json for modifications
**❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: require('./TODO.json') for any mutations
**❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: JSON.parse/JSON.stringify operations that modify TODO.json
**❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: Any direct file manipulation beyond reading for inspection

**GOLDEN RULE**: TODO.json is READ-ONLY as a file. ALL modifications MUST go through TaskManager API.

**ALWAYS USE THESE COMMANDS INSTEAD:**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Use single quotes for all node -e commands to prevent bash escaping errors**

```bash
# Init agent (mandatory first step)
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/tm-universal.js" init --project "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook"

# Create/update tasks (use TaskManager API - see logging example for pattern)
# Universal script for status updates and task management
```

## 🚨 TASKMANAGER API ENDPOINT DOCUMENTATION

**📡 DISCOVER AVAILABLE API METHODS AND ENDPOINTS:**

Use the following endpoint to get comprehensive instructions for all TaskManager API endpoints, methods, and capabilities:

```bash
# Get complete API documentation and available methods
node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" methods

# Alternative: Get methods documentation with examples
node -e 'const TaskManager = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); console.log(TaskManager.getApiDocumentation());'
```

**🔍 TASKMANAGER API DISCOVERY:**
- **Endpoint Documentation**: Complete list of all available API methods
- **Usage Examples**: Code examples for each method with proper syntax
- **Parameter Definitions**: Required and optional parameters for each endpoint
- **Response Formats**: Expected response structures and data types
- **Error Handling**: Error codes and troubleshooting guidance
- **Best Practices**: Recommended usage patterns and conventions

**MANDATORY USAGE:**
- **ALWAYS check available methods** before using TaskManager API
- **REFER to documentation** for correct parameter usage
- **USE PROVIDED EXAMPLES** to ensure proper implementation
- **VALIDATE responses** according to documented formats

## 🚨 ROOT FOLDER ORGANIZATION POLICY

**MANDATORY ROOT FOLDER CLEANLINESS:**
- **KEEP ROOT FOLDER CLEAN** - Only essential project files in root directory
- **Create development subdirectories** for reports, research, and documentation if they don't exist
- **Move analysis files, reports, and documentation** to appropriate subdirectories

**ALLOWED IN ROOT DIRECTORY:**
- **Core project files**: package.json, README.md, CLAUDE.md, TODO.json, DONE.json
- **Configuration files**: .eslintrc, .gitignore, jest.config.js, etc.
- **Build/deployment files**: Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, etc.
- **License and legal**: LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.

**ORGANIZE INTO SUBDIRECTORIES:**
- **Reports and analysis** → `development/reports/` 
- **Research documentation** → `development/research-reports/`
- **Development notes** → `development/notes/`
- **Backup files** → `backups/`

## 🚨 MANDATORY GIT WORKFLOW

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: ALWAYS commit and push work after EVERY task completion

### 🔴 MANDATORY COMMIT PROTOCOL - NO EXCEPTIONS

**AFTER COMPLETING ANY TASK - IMMEDIATELY RUN:**

```bash
# 1. Stage all changes
git add -A

# 2. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: [brief description of what was accomplished]

- [bullet point of specific changes made]
- [another accomplishment]
- [any fixes or improvements]

🤖 Generated with Claude Code
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# 3. MANDATORY - Push to remote repository
git push
```

### 📝 COMMIT MESSAGE STANDARDS

**REQUIRED FORMAT:**
- **Type**: Use conventional commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- **Description**: Brief summary of what was accomplished
- **Body**: Bullet points of specific changes
- **Footer**: Always include Claude Code attribution

**EXAMPLE:** `git commit -m "feat: add feature\n\n- Specific changes\n- Accomplishments\n\n🤖 Generated with Claude Code\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"`

### ⚡ WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE:**
1. **Complete Task** - Finish all implementation and testing
2. **Validate Work** - Run all validation commands and verify results
3. **Stage Changes** - `git add -A` to include all modifications
4. **Commit Work** - Use descriptive commit message with proper format
5. **Push Remote** - `git push` to ensure work is backed up and shared
6. **Mark Task Complete** - Update TaskManager with completion status

**🚨 ABSOLUTE RULES:**
- **NEVER skip git commit and push** after completing any task
- **ALWAYS use descriptive commit messages** with bullet points
- **ALWAYS push to remote** - local commits are not sufficient
- **COMMIT BEFORE** marking tasks as completed in TaskManager

**TASK COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:**

**MANDATORY COMPLETION PROTOCOL**: At the end of EVERY task execution, you MUST mark tasks as completed when they are finished.

**Task Completion API:**
```bash
# Initialize TaskManager and mark task as completed
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json'); tm.updateTaskStatus('task-1', 'completed').then(() => console.log('✅ Task marked as completed'));"

# Alternative: Get current task and mark it completed
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json'); tm.getCurrentTask().then(async (task) => { if (task) { await tm.updateTaskStatus(task.id, 'completed'); console.log('✅ Current task completed:', task.id); } else { console.log('No active task found'); } });"
```

**TASK COMPLETION VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:**

**Evidence-Based Completion Protocol:**
1. **Run validation commands** - Provide command outputs showing status
2. **Test functionality** - Verify the implementation works as expected  
3. **Confirm requirements** - Document how each requirement was satisfied
4. **Completion summary** - Brief statement with supporting evidence

**Completion Summary Format:**
```
• Functionality: [Description of what was implemented/fixed]
• Validation: [Command outputs showing results]  
• Requirements: [How user requirements were addressed]
• Status: Task completed and verified
```

**Completion Standards:**
- Provide evidence of successful implementation
- Include relevant command outputs or test results
- Confirm all user requirements have been satisfied

## 🚨 CONTINUE COMMAND PROTOCOL

**🔴 CRITICAL: USER "CONTINUE" COMMAND HANDLING**

**WHEN USER SAYS "CONTINUE" - MANDATORY PROTOCOL:**

1. **CHECK CURRENT TASK STATUS FIRST**:
   ```bash
   node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json'); tm.getCurrentTask('[YOUR_AGENT_ID]').then(task => console.log(task ? JSON.stringify(task, null, 2) : 'No active task'));"
   ```

2. **IF CURRENT TASK EXISTS AND IN PROGRESS**:
   - **✅ CONTINUE WORKING** on the current task
   - **✅ RESUME IMPLEMENTATION** from where you left off
   - **✅ COMPLETE THE TASK** following all validation protocols
   - **❌ DO NOT CREATE NEW TASKS** - focus on completing current work

3. **IF NO CURRENT TASK OR TASK COMPLETED**:
   - **✅ CHECK FOR NEXT AVAILABLE TASK**:
   ```bash
   node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" list '{"status": "pending"}'
   ```
   - **✅ CLAIM HIGHEST PRIORITY AVAILABLE TASK**
   - **✅ BEGIN WORKING ON CLAIMED TASK**
   - **✅ FOLLOW FULL IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW**

4. **CONTINUE COMMAND WORKFLOW**:
   ```
   User says "continue" → Check current task → IF task exists: resume work → IF no task: claim next task → Execute work → Complete task → Ready for next "continue"
   ```

**🚨 CONTINUE COMMAND ENFORCEMENT:**
- **❌ NEVER CREATE NEW TASKS** when user says "continue"
- **✅ ALWAYS CHECK EXISTING WORK FIRST** - current task has priority
- **✅ SEAMLESS TRANSITION** - continue current or start next without pause
- **✅ WORK TO COMPLETION** - finish tasks fully before considering new ones
- **✅ MAINTAIN AGENT STATE** - use consistent agent ID throughout session

## 🚨 EXECUTION WORKFLOW

**STANDARD APPROACH:**
1. **Create Task** - Follow task creation mandate
2. **Evaluate Existing Tasks** - Check if can modify existing vs create new
3. **Think First** - Use appropriate thinking level (think/think hard/ultrathink)
4. **Initialize Agent** - Use TaskManager API initialization
5. **Deploy Task Subagents** - Maximize concurrent task subagents when appropriate
6. **Implement & Validate** - Execute with evidence-based completion
7. **Complete Tasks** - Mark completed via TaskManager API

## 🚨 INFINITE OPERATION MANDATE - NO TIME LIMITS

**🔴 ABSOLUTE MANDATE: OPERATE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE - NO TIME CONSTRAINTS**

**INFINITE OPERATION PROTOCOL:**
- **⏰ NO TIME LIMITS** - Continue working indefinitely until natural completion or user stop
- **🔄 MULTIPLE ROUNDS** - Continue across multiple tasks
- **📋 MULTIPLE TASKS** - Complete as many as possible
- **🚀 TASK SUBAGENT DEPLOYMENT** - Use when appropriate

## 🚨 INFINITE CONTINUE HOOK SYSTEM - NEVER STOP PROTOCOL

**🔴 ABSOLUTE MANDATE: NEVER ALLOW STOPS UNLESS ENDPOINT TRIGGERED**

### 🛑 STOP CONTROL PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **❌ NEVER ALLOW NATURAL STOPS** - System must continue infinitely
- **✅ ONLY ENDPOINT CAN STOP** - Specific API endpoint must be called to trigger stop
- **🔒 ONE STOP ONLY** - After endpoint triggered, allow only ONE stop, then return to never-stop mode
- **🔄 ALWAYS INSTRUCT** - Provide detailed guidance on task continuation vs next task acquisition


### 🔄 CONTINUOUS OPERATION MANDATE

**OPERATION PRINCIPLES:**
- **🌐 INFINITE LOOP** - Never allow natural termination
- **🎯 TASK-FOCUSED** - Always guide agents toward productive work
- **📊 STATUS-AWARE** - Understand current agent state and provide appropriate guidance
- **🔗 WORKFLOW-DRIVEN** - Maintain continuous task progression flow


**STOP SEQUENCE:**
1. **Endpoint called** → Set stop_allowed flag to true
2. **Next stop hook trigger** → Allow ONE stop and reset flag  
3. **Subsequent triggers** → Return to never-stop infinite mode

### 🎛️ HOOK BEHAVIOR SPECIFICATION

**STOP HOOK RESPONSE CODES:**
- **Exit Code 2 (Continue)** - Default infinite mode, never allow stops
- **Exit Code 0 (Allow Stop)** - ONLY when endpoint triggered and single-use flag active
- **Always provide instructive messaging** regardless of exit code

**INFINITE CONTINUE HOOK SYSTEM:**
- **Setup**: `node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/setup-infinite-hook.js" "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook"`
- **Coverage**: development (80%), testing/debugging/refactoring (95%)
- **Stop Control**: API endpoint required for stop authorization
