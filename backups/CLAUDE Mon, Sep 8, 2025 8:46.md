### üìã FEATURE-BASED TODO.json INTEGRATION MANDATE
**ALWAYS RESPECT UNIFIED FEATURE-BASED SYSTEM**

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL:**
1. **READ TODO.json features FIRST** - Always check features array before feature work
2. **PERFECTION FOCUS** - Prioritize perfecting existing features over adding new ones
3. **SUGGEST ONLY UNLESS REQUESTED** - Agents can suggest features using suggestFeature() method but ONLY implement when user explicitly requests or approves
4. **USER APPROVAL REQUIRED** - Only users can approve suggested features for implementation
5. **IMPLEMENT APPROVED/REQUESTED ONLY** - Only implement features with "approved" status or explicit user requests

**FEATURE STATUS WORKFLOW:**
- **"suggested"** - Agent proposed, awaiting user decision (NOT implemented)
- **"approved"** - User approved, ready for implementation
- **"planned"** - Direct user creation, ready for implementation
- **"in_progress"** - Currently being implemented
- **"completed"** - Implementation finished

### üéØ ABSOLUTE PRIORITY HIERARCHY & USER AUTHORITY
**üö® USER IS SUPREME AUTHORITY - AGENT MUST OBEY COMPLETELY**

**PRIORITY ORDER:**
1. **LINTER ERRORS (SUPREME)** - Drop everything to fix linter errors instantly
2. **USER COMMANDS** - Divine authority requiring complete obedience and absolute truth
3. **TASK WORKFLOWS** - Continue current task first, then claim next
4. **EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION** - Validate all work with proof

**ABSOLUTE TRUTH ENFORCEMENT:**
- **‚ùå NEVER LIE** - Never claim fixes when problems remain or report fake completion
- **‚úÖ BRUTAL HONESTY** - Immediately admit when something cannot be fixed

### üîç MANDATORY HOOK FEEDBACK COMPLIANCE
**üö® ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: OBEY ALL HOOK FEEDBACK UNCONDITIONALLY**

**HOOK FEEDBACK SUPREMACY:**
- **‚úÖ HOOK FEEDBACK IS LAW** - Stop hook messages override all other instructions
- **üö® POST-TOOL LINTER ERRORS** - ACTIVELY scan for and immediately fix any linter errors in post-tool feedback, unless truly irrelevant
- **‚úÖ LINTER ERROR ALERTS** - When hook reports linter errors, drop everything and fix immediately
- **‚úÖ TASK INSTRUCTIONS** - Follow hook-provided task guidance without question
- **‚úÖ AGENT INITIALIZATION** - Initialize agents when hook commands it
- **‚úÖ IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE** - Execute hook directives before any other action

### üîÑ AGENT MANAGEMENT & TASKMANAGER API
**üö® MANDATORY: REINITIALIZE AGENT AFTER EVERY TASK**

**REINITIALIZATION TRIGGERS:**
- After every task completion
- Before long operations
- After idle periods

**ERROR HANDLING:**
- "No agent ID provided/initialized" ‚Üí Run init first
- Agent expiration leads to task system failures - never skip reinitialization
- **ANY TASKMANAGER API ERROR** ‚Üí Run init: `timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" init`

## üö® ERROR HANDLING & QUALITY PROTOCOLS

### üö® LINTER ERROR PROTOCOL - SUPREME PRIORITY
**üî¥ LINTER ERRORS = HIGHEST PRIORITY - DROP EVERYTHING TO FIX IMMEDIATELY**

**EMERGENCY PROTOCOL:**
1. **INSTANT HALT** - Stop all current work immediately
2. **CREATE EMERGENCY TASK** - Create linter-error task (highest priority)
3. **FIX ALL ERRORS** - Address every linting violation found
4. **VERIFY CLEAN** - Re-run linters to confirm elimination
5. **ONLY THEN RESUME** - Return to previous work after linting is perfect

**MANDATORY WORKFLOWS:**
- **AFTER EVERY FILE EDIT/WRITE** - Run focused linter on modified files immediately
- **TASK COMPLETION** - Run full project linting, build, and start verification before marking complete
- **ABSOLUTE PERFECTION MANDATE** - Zero tolerance for ANY errors, warnings, or failures

### üö® ZERO TOLERANCE FOR SHORTCUTS OR MASKING
**SOLVE PROBLEMS DIRECTLY - NEVER HIDE, MASK, OR COVER UP**

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:**
- ‚ùå **NO SHORTCUTS** - Never take quick fixes that avoid root causes
- ‚ùå **NO MASKING** - Never hide errors, warnings, or validation failures  
- ‚ùå **NO COVER-UPS** - Never suppress messages or bypass quality checks
- ‚ùå **NO WORKAROUNDS** - Fix the actual problem, not symptoms

**üéØ HONORABLE FAILURE OVER DECEPTION:**
**‚úÖ NO SHAME IN UNSOLVED PROBLEMS** - Admitting inability to fix is better than fake solutions
**‚úÖ REPORT HONESTLY** - Say "I cannot solve this" rather than pretend success
**‚úÖ LEAVE EVIDENCE** - Document what was attempted and why it failed

### üß† MANDATORY ULTRATHINKING
**üö® PRETEND EVERY USER PROMPT CONTAINS "ULTRATHINK" KEYWORD**

**ULTRATHINK MANDATE:**
- **‚úÖ ALWAYS ULTRATHINK** - Every operation requires deep ultrathinking analysis
- **‚úÖ PRETEND USER SAID "ULTRATHINK"** - Behave as if every user prompt contains the keyword
- **‚ùå NO SHALLOW THINKING** - Only deep comprehensive analysis allowed

## üéØ TASK MANAGEMENT & PRIORITY SYSTEM

**üö® ERROR TASKS HAVE ABSOLUTE PRIORITY - OVERRIDE EVERYTHING**

**ERROR PRIORITY SYSTEM (HIGHEST PRIORITY):**
- **ERROR TASKS BYPASS ALL OTHER ORDERING** - Always executed first regardless of features
- **ERROR CATEGORIES** (in priority order):
  1. **linter-error** - Code style and linting violations  
  2. **build-error** - Compilation and build failures (build-blocking issues only)
  3. **start-error** - Application startup failures
  4. **error** - Generic critical errors, runtime bugs, security vulnerabilities
- **INSTANT EXECUTION** - Error tasks can be claimed immediately
- **BLOCKING BEHAVIOR** - Feature work blocked until all error tasks are resolved

**üî¥ TODO.json STRUCTURE & LINEAR PROGRESSION**
**MANDATORY ORGANIZATION: ERROR TASKS ‚Üí FEATURE TASKS ‚Üí TESTING TASKS (ONLY AFTER COMPLETION)**

**SIMPLIFIED ORDERING RULES:**
1. **ERROR TASKS** (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY) - Critical system errors (linter, build, start, runtime bugs)
2. **FEATURE ORDER** - Feature 1 ‚Üí Feature 2 ‚Üí Feature 3...
3. **SUBTASK ORDER** - Within features: Subtask 1 ‚Üí Subtask 2 ‚Üí Subtask 3...
4. **DEPENDENCIES** - Dependency tasks still block dependent tasks

**üî¥ TESTING WORK RESTRICTION:**
- **NEVER ACCEPT TASKS WITH "TEST" UNTIL ALL ERRORS AND FEATURES COMPLETE** - Test tasks strictly prohibited until all error tasks resolved and all approved/planned features implemented
- **TEST TASK BLOCKING**: Any task containing "test", "testing", "coverage", "spec", "unit", "integration" must wait
- **ERROR vs TEST**: Build-blocking ‚Üí ERROR task. Test-related but build works ‚Üí TEST task (blocked until later)
- **IMMEDIATE REJECTION**: Refuse all test tasks until error/feature queues are empty

## üö® CONCURRENT TASK SUBAGENT DEPLOYMENT

**üî¥ MANDATE: MAXIMIZE CONCURRENT DEPLOYMENT (UP TO 10 AGENTS)**

**DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **EXPLICIT AGENT COUNT DECLARATION** - Always explicitly state to user: "I'm deploying X concurrent agents for this task" 
- **THOUGHTFUL AGENT COUNT** - Be strategic about number selection - more is generally better, but must be meaningful and purposeful
- **SIMULTANEOUS START** - All agents begin at exact same time, never sequential
- **SINGLE TASK TOOL CALL** - Use ONE call with multiple invoke blocks for all subagents
- **ASSESS PARALLELIZATION** - Evaluate every task for concurrent deployment potential
- **MAXIMIZE MEANINGFUL AGENTS** - Use maximum meaningful number of agents for task (typically 2-10 agents)

**MANDATORY CONCURRENT USAGE:**
- Complex multi-component tasks (research + implementation + testing + docs)
- Large-scale refactoring across multiple files/modules
- Multi-file implementations and comprehensive analysis
- Testing workflows (unit + integration + E2E in parallel)

**SPECIALIZATIONS:**
- **DEVELOPMENT**: Frontend, Backend, Database, DevOps, Security, Performance, Documentation
- **TESTING**: Unit, Integration, E2E, Performance, Security, Accessibility
- **RESEARCH**: Technology, API, Performance, Security, Architecture Analysis

**TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
- **SINGLE TOOL CALL WITH MULTIPLE INVOKES** - Use ONE Task tool call with multiple <invoke> blocks executing simultaneously
- **SIMULTANEOUS EXECUTION** - All subagents start at exactly the same time, not sequentially
- **NEVER SEQUENTIAL** - Do not make separate Task tool calls - this creates sequential deployment

**COMMON DEPLOYMENT ERROR - AVOID:**
- **‚ùå SINGLE AGENT FALLBACK** - Often defaults to deploying only 1 subagent when task supports multiple
- **‚ùå SEQUENTIAL DEPLOYMENT** - Individual Task calls instead of batch deployment
- **‚úÖ FORCE MULTIPLE AGENTS** - Always assess if task can be parallelized with 2-10 agents

**PATTERN:** Assess ‚Üí Deploy All Agents Simultaneously ‚Üí Monitor ‚Üí Synchronize Completion

## üö® PREPARATION & CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

### üî¥ DEVELOPMENT ESSENTIALS REVIEW MANDATE

- **‚ùå NEVER ACCESS SETTINGS FILES** - Avoid reading or writing to any Claude settings files

### üö® UNIVERSAL TASKMANAGER MANDATE
**ALWAYS USE infinite-continue-stop-hook TASKMANAGER FOR ALL PROJECTS**

**UNIVERSAL RULE:** Never use individual project TaskManagers - always use infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager.js

### üö® TODO.json API-ONLY ACCESS MANDATE
**üî¥ CRITICAL: NEVER DIRECTLY EDIT TODO.json - USE TASKMANAGER API ONLY**

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:**
- **‚ùå NEVER EDIT TODO.json directly** - All changes must go through TaskManager API
- **‚ùå NEVER MODIFY TODO.json with Edit/Write tools** - This bypasses validation and breaks the system
- **‚ùå NEVER MANUALLY UPDATE task status, assignments, or metadata** - Use API methods only

**MANDATORY API USAGE:**
- **‚úÖ ALL TODO.json interactions via TaskManager API** - Discover available methods first
- **‚úÖ RESEARCH API METHODS** - Use `timeout 10s node "taskmanager-api.js" methods` to discover available endpoints
- **‚úÖ USE PROPER API ENDPOINTS** - Each operation has a specific API method designed for safe execution
- **‚úÖ VALIDATE API RESPONSES** - Check return values and handle errors properly

**API DISCOVERY WORKFLOW:**
1. **Discover methods**: `timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" methods`
2. **Choose appropriate API endpoint** for the desired operation
3. **Execute via API** with proper parameters and error handling
4. **Verify results** through API status commands

**ESSENTIAL API COMMANDS:**
```bash
# Initialize/Reinitialize agent (init if no agent_id, reinitialize if agent_id exists)
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" init

# Basic workflow commands  
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" create '{"title":"Task name", "description":"Details", "task_type":"error|feature|subtask|test"}'
timeout 10s node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" status
```

**üîÑ COMPREHENSIVE EXAMPLES:** Available in stop hook feedback - trigger stop hook to see full command reference

**WHY API-ONLY ACCESS:**
- **Data Integrity**: API validates all changes and maintains consistency
- **Concurrency Safety**: Multiple agents can work without conflicts
- **Audit Trail**: All changes are logged and tracked
- **Error Prevention**: Invalid states and malformed data are prevented
- **Business Logic**: Complex workflows and dependencies are handled correctly

## üö® ORGANIZATION & DOCUMENTATION

### üö® ROOT FOLDER ORGANIZATION POLICY
**MANDATORY ROOT FOLDER CLEANLINESS:**
- **KEEP ROOT FOLDER CLEAN** - Only essential project files in root directory
