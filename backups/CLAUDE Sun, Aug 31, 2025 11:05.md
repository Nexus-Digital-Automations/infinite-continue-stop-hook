## üö® ERROR HANDLING & QUALITY PROTOCOLS


### üö® **LINTER ERROR PROTOCOL - SUPREME PRIORITY**
**üî¥ LINTER ERRORS = HIGHEST PRIORITY - DROP EVERYTHING TO FIX IMMEDIATELY**

**MANDATORY LINTER WORKFLOW:**
1. **DETECT linter error** ‚Üí **INSTANTLY CREATE linter-error task**
2. **DROP ALL OTHER WORK** ‚Üí Fix linter errors immediately  
3. **Run validation**: npm run lint, npm run typecheck, etc.
4. **Fix any errors found** - never ignore or suppress
5. **Re-run linter to verify fixes**
6. **ONLY THEN continue other work**

**üî¥ MANDATORY FOCUSED LINTER CHECK AFTER EVERY FILE OPERATION:**
**üö® ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: RUN FOCUSED LINTER ON MODIFIED FILES/FOLDERS - NO EXCEPTIONS**

- **‚úÖ AFTER EVERY EDIT** - Run focused linter check on edited file and its parent folder immediately
- **‚úÖ AFTER EVERY WRITE** - Run focused linter check on new file and its parent folder immediately  
- **‚úÖ LANGUAGE AGNOSTIC** - Use appropriate linter for each language (eslint, ruff, black, pylint, etc.)
- **‚úÖ FOCUSED SCOPE** - Only check the specific files/folders being worked on, not entire project
- **‚úÖ IMMEDIATE DETECTION** - Catch linter errors the instant they are introduced
- **‚úÖ FIX INSTANTLY** - If linting fails, create linter-error task and fix immediately
- **‚ùå NO EXCEPTIONS** - This applies to ALL file modifications, no matter how small
- **‚ùå NO DELAYS** - Focused linter checks must happen immediately after file operations

**POST-EDIT FOCUSED LINTER CHECK SEQUENCE:**
1. **Edit or write any file**
2. **IMMEDIATELY run focused linter on**:
   - **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `eslint [file/folder]`
   - **Python**: `ruff check [file/folder]` or `pylint [file/folder]`
   - **Go**: `golint [file/folder]` or `go vet [file/folder]`
   - **Rust**: `clippy [file/folder]`
   - **Other languages**: Use appropriate language-specific linter
3. **IF errors found** ‚Üí Create linter-error task INSTANTLY and fix
4. **IF clean** ‚Üí Continue with next operation
5. **NEVER skip this step** - mandatory for every file operation

**TASK COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS (PROJECT-WIDE VALIDATION):**
- **ALWAYS run full project linter checks** before marking any task complete (npm run lint, ruff ., etc.)
- **ALWAYS fix all errors** before completion
- **ALWAYS provide validation evidence** showing clean results across entire project
- If project-wide linting fails ‚Üí Create new linter-error task IMMEDIATELY

### ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ISSUE MASKING
**ALWAYS FIX ROOT CAUSE - NEVER HIDE PROBLEMS**

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:**
- ‚ùå MASK validation errors - Fix the validation logic, don't bypass it
- ‚ùå SUPPRESS error messages - Fix the error, don't hide it
- ‚ùå BYPASS quality checks - Fix the code to pass checks
- ‚ùå IMPLEMENT WORKAROUNDS - Fix the root cause, don't work around it
- ‚ùå HIDE FAILING TESTS - Fix the tests or code, don't disable them
- ‚ùå IGNORE LINTING ERRORS - Fix the linting violations
- ‚ùå DISABLE WARNINGS OR CHECKS - Address what's causing the warnings

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS PROTOCOL:**
1. **IDENTIFY** the true root cause
2. **ANALYZE** why the issue exists
3. **FIX** the underlying problem
4. **VALIDATE** the fix resolves the issue
5. **DOCUMENT** the resolution

**FORBIDDEN MASKING EXAMPLES:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - Masking validation
if (!result.isValid) return { success: true };

// ‚úÖ REQUIRED - Fixing validation
if (!result.isValid) {
    fixValidationIssue(result.errors);
    // Re-run validation to ensure it passes
}
```

**QUALITY GATE PRINCIPLE:** Every error is a quality gate that must be properly addressed - never masked, always fixed.

### THINKING & VALIDATION PROTOCOLS

**üß† MANDATORY ULTRATHINKING - ALWAYS ACTIVE**
**üö® PRETEND EVERY USER PROMPT AND HOOK CONTAINS "ULTRATHINK" KEYWORD**

**ULTRATHINK MANDATE:**
- **‚úÖ ALWAYS ULTRATHINK** - Every operation requires deep ultrathinking analysis
- **‚úÖ PRETEND USER SAID "ULTRATHINK"** - Behave as if every user prompt and hook feedback contains the "ultrathink" keyword
- **‚úÖ STOP HOOK ULTRATHINK** - Process all stop hook feedback with ultrathinking as if it contained "ultrathink" command
- **‚ùå NO SHALLOW THINKING** - Only deep comprehensive analysis allowed

**EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLETION:**
1. Run validation commands - show all outputs
2. Test functionality manually - demonstrate it works
3. Verify requirements met - list each satisfied requirement
4. Provide evidence - paste command outputs proving success

**AUTO-SORTING:** Category Rank ‚Üí Priority Value ‚Üí Creation Time

**TASK CREATION COMMANDS:**
```bash
# CRITICAL: ALWAYS USE SINGLE QUOTES to avoid bash escaping errors

# Linter error (highest priority)
node -e 'const TaskManager = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); const tm = new TaskManager("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json"); tm.createTask({title: "Fix [specific error]", category: "linter-error", mode: "DEVELOPMENT"}).then(id => console.log("Created:", id));'

# Feature implementation
node -e 'const TaskManager = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); const tm = new TaskManager("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json"); tm.createTask({title: "Implement [feature]", category: "missing-feature", mode: "DEVELOPMENT"}).then(id => console.log("Created:", id));'

# Research task
node -e 'const TaskManager = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); const tm = new TaskManager("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json"); tm.createTask({title: "Research [topic]", category: "research", mode: "DEVELOPMENT"}).then(id => console.log("Created:", id));'
```

## üö® TASK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS

**ALWAYS CREATE TASKS FOR:**
- Every user request/instruction
- All detected errors (linting, runtime, build, test failures)
- Performance issues and security vulnerabilities
- Code quality opportunities and missing functionality
- Integration issues and improvement opportunities

**WORKFLOW:** User request ‚Üí Create task ‚Üí Check existing ‚Üí Execute


## üö® BASH ESCAPING PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL RULE: ALWAYS USE SINGLE QUOTES FOR NODE -E COMMANDS**

**Common Errors:** SyntaxError from improper quote escaping, shell interference with JavaScript

**CORRECT PATTERNS:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Single quotes for shell, double quotes for JavaScript
node -e 'const tm = require("/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager"); tm.createTask({title: "Task"});'

# ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - Double quotes for outer shell
node -e "const tm = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager');"
```

**Troubleshooting:** Switch to single quotes, use double quotes inside JavaScript, create temp file for complex commands

## üö® CONCURRENT TASK SUBAGENT DEPLOYMENT

**üî¥ MAXIMIZE CONCURRENT SIMULTANEOUS DEPLOYMENT**

Deploy as many concurrent task subagents simultaneously as appropriate (up to 10 maximum) when tasks have parallelizable components.

**CONCURRENT DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **‚úÖ SIMULTANEOUS START** - All agents must begin AT THE SAME TIME
- **‚úÖ MAXIMIZE PARALLELIZATION** - Break work into parallel streams
- **‚úÖ APPROPRIATE SCALING** - Use as many agents as task meaningfully supports
- **‚ùå NEVER SEQUENTIAL** - Multiple agents running one after another forbidden unless dependency chain exists

**APPROPRIATE USAGE:**
- **‚úÖ Complex multi-component tasks** - Research, implementation, testing, documentation in parallel
- **‚úÖ Large scale refactoring** - Multiple files/modules handled simultaneously
- **‚úÖ Comprehensive analysis** - Different aspects analyzed concurrently
- **‚ùå Simple single-file edits** - One agent more efficient
- **‚ùå Trivial operations** - Basic validation, simple queries

**SPECIALIZATIONS BY MODE:**
- **DEVELOPMENT**: Frontend, Backend, Database, DevOps, Security
- **TESTING**: Unit Test, Integration Test, E2E Test, Performance Test, Security Test
- **RESEARCH**: Technology Evaluator, API Analyst, Performance Researcher, Security Auditor
- **DEBUGGING**: Error Analysis, Performance Profiling, Security Audit, Code Quality

**DEPLOYMENT PATTERN:** Think ‚Üí Map Distribution ‚Üí Deploy Simultaneously ‚Üí Monitor ‚Üí Synchronize Completion


## üö® CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

**Always check for ABOUT.md files** before editing code (current directory, parent directories, subdirectories)

## üö® DEVELOPMENT ESSENTIALS REVIEW MANDATE

**üî¥ ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: ALWAYS READ/REVIEW DEVELOPMENT/ESSENTIALS DIRECTORY**

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL:**
1. **CHECK development/essentials/** - Always check if development/essentials directory exists
2. **READ ALL ESSENTIAL FILES** - Review every file in development/essentials before starting any work
3. **CRITICAL CONTEXT** - Files in development/essentials contain critical project context and requirements
4. **NEVER SKIP** - Never begin implementation without reviewing essentials directory content
5. **UPDATE AWARENESS** - Re-check development/essentials if it gets created during project lifecycle

**ESSENTIAL FILES PRIORITY:**
- **Project-specific constraints** - Technical limitations and requirements
- **Architecture decisions** - Core design patterns and principles  
- **Security requirements** - Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Performance standards** - Optimization requirements and benchmarks
- **Integration specifications** - External service dependencies and protocols
- **Deployment considerations** - Environment-specific configurations

**WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:**
- **Before task execution** - Review development/essentials as first step
- **During planning** - Reference essentials for implementation decisions
- **For complex tasks** - Include essentials review in task dependencies
- **When blocked** - Check essentials for guidance and constraints

**NOTE**: If development/essentials directory doesn't exist, this requirement is dormant until the directory is created.

## üö® RESEARCH REPORTS INTEGRATION & DEPENDENCY SYSTEM

**üî¥ ABSOLUTE MANDATE: ALWAYS READ RELEVANT RESEARCH REPORTS FIRST**

**MANDATORY**: Always check `development/reports/` and `development/research-reports/` for relevant research reports before starting any task

**üö® DEPENDENCY SYSTEM BEHAVIOR:**
- **Dependencies ALWAYS come first** in task queue regardless of category
- **Any task can depend on any other task** - not limited to research dependencies
- **Dependent tasks are BLOCKED** until all dependencies complete  
- **Task claiming will redirect** to dependency tasks with instructions
- **Use TaskManager API** for automatic dependency detection and guidance

## üö® CODING STANDARDS

**MANDATORY**: All agents MUST follow the standardized coding conventions defined in the global CLAUDE.md at `/Users/jeremyparker/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

These standards ensure consistency across large codebases and multi-agent collaboration, covering:

node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json'); tm.updateTaskStatus('task-1', 'completed').then(() => console.log('‚úÖ Task marked as completed'));"

# Alternative: Get current task and mark it completed
node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json'); tm.getCurrentTask().then(async (task) => { if (task) { await tm.updateTaskStatus(task.id, 'completed'); console.log('‚úÖ Current task completed:', task.id); } else { console.log('No active task found'); } });"
```

**TASK COMPLETION VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:**

**Evidence-Based Completion Protocol:**
1. **Run validation commands** - Provide command outputs showing status
2. **Test functionality** - Verify the implementation works as expected  
3. **Confirm requirements** - Document how each requirement was satisfied
4. **Completion summary** - Brief statement with supporting evidence

**Completion Summary Format:**
```
‚Ä¢ Functionality: [Description of what was implemented/fixed]
‚Ä¢ Validation: [Command outputs showing results]  
‚Ä¢ Requirements: [How user requirements were addressed]
‚Ä¢ Status: Task completed and verified
```

**Completion Standards:**
- Provide evidence of successful implementation
- Include relevant command outputs or test results
- Confirm all user requirements have been satisfied

## üö® CONTINUE COMMAND PROTOCOL

**üî¥ CRITICAL: USER "CONTINUE" COMMAND HANDLING**

**WHEN USER SAYS "CONTINUE" - MANDATORY PROTOCOL:**

1. **CHECK CURRENT TASK STATUS FIRST**:
   ```bash
   node -e "const TaskManager = require('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/lib/taskManager'); const tm = new TaskManager('/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/TODO.json'); tm.getCurrentTask('[YOUR_AGENT_ID]').then(task => console.log(task ? JSON.stringify(task, null, 2) : 'No active task'));"
   ```

2. **IF CURRENT TASK EXISTS AND IN PROGRESS**:
   - **‚úÖ CONTINUE WORKING** on the current task
   - **‚úÖ RESUME IMPLEMENTATION** from where you left off
   - **‚úÖ COMPLETE THE TASK** following all validation protocols
   - **‚ùå DO NOT CREATE NEW TASKS** - focus on completing current work

3. **IF NO CURRENT TASK OR TASK COMPLETED**:
   - **‚úÖ CHECK FOR NEXT AVAILABLE TASK**:
   ```bash
   node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/taskmanager-api.js" list '{"status": "pending"}'
   ```
   - **‚úÖ CLAIM HIGHEST PRIORITY AVAILABLE TASK**
   - **‚úÖ BEGIN WORKING ON CLAIMED TASK**
   - **‚úÖ FOLLOW FULL IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW**

4. **CONTINUE COMMAND WORKFLOW**:
   ```
   User says "continue" ‚Üí Check current task ‚Üí IF task exists: resume work ‚Üí IF no task: claim next task ‚Üí Execute work ‚Üí Complete task ‚Üí Ready for next "continue"
   ```

**üö® CONTINUE COMMAND ENFORCEMENT:**
- **‚ùå NEVER CREATE NEW TASKS** when user says "continue"
- **‚úÖ ALWAYS CHECK EXISTING WORK FIRST** - current task has priority
- **‚úÖ SEAMLESS TRANSITION** - continue current or start next without pause
- **‚úÖ WORK TO COMPLETION** - finish tasks fully before considering new ones
- **‚úÖ MAINTAIN AGENT STATE** - use consistent agent ID throughout session

## üö® EXECUTION WORKFLOW

**STANDARD APPROACH:**
1. **Create Task** - Follow task creation mandate
2. **Evaluate Existing Tasks** - Check if can modify existing vs create new
3. **Think First** - Use appropriate thinking level (think/think hard/ultrathink)
4. **Initialize Agent** - Use TaskManager API initialization
5. **Deploy Task Subagents** - Maximize concurrent task subagents when appropriate
6. **Implement & Validate** - Execute with evidence-based completion
7. **Complete Tasks** - Mark completed via TaskManager API

## üö® INFINITE OPERATION MANDATE - NO TIME LIMITS

**üî¥ ABSOLUTE MANDATE: OPERATE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE - NO TIME CONSTRAINTS**

**INFINITE OPERATION PROTOCOL:**
- **‚è∞ NO TIME LIMITS** - Continue working indefinitely until natural completion or user stop
- **üîÑ MULTIPLE ROUNDS** - Continue across multiple tasks
- **üìã MULTIPLE TASKS** - Complete as many as possible
- **üöÄ TASK SUBAGENT DEPLOYMENT** - Use when appropriate

## üö® INFINITE CONTINUE HOOK SYSTEM - NEVER STOP PROTOCOL

**üî¥ ABSOLUTE MANDATE: NEVER ALLOW STOPS UNLESS ENDPOINT TRIGGERED**

### üõë STOP CONTROL PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **‚ùå NEVER ALLOW NATURAL STOPS** - System must continue infinitely
- **‚úÖ ONLY ENDPOINT CAN STOP** - Specific API endpoint must be called to trigger stop
- **üîí ONE STOP ONLY** - After endpoint triggered, allow only ONE stop, then return to never-stop mode
- **üîÑ ALWAYS INSTRUCT** - Provide detailed guidance on task continuation vs next task acquisition


### üîÑ CONTINUOUS OPERATION MANDATE

**OPERATION PRINCIPLES:**
- **üåê INFINITE LOOP** - Never allow natural termination
- **üéØ TASK-FOCUSED** - Always guide agents toward productive work
- **üìä STATUS-AWARE** - Understand current agent state and provide appropriate guidance
- **üîó WORKFLOW-DRIVEN** - Maintain continuous task progression flow


**STOP SEQUENCE:**
1. **Endpoint called** ‚Üí Set stop_allowed flag to true
2. **Next stop hook trigger** ‚Üí Allow ONE stop and reset flag  
3. **Subsequent triggers** ‚Üí Return to never-stop infinite mode

### üéõÔ∏è HOOK BEHAVIOR SPECIFICATION

**STOP HOOK RESPONSE CODES:**
- **Exit Code 2 (Continue)** - Default infinite mode, never allow stops
- **Exit Code 0 (Allow Stop)** - ONLY when endpoint triggered and single-use flag active
- **Always provide instructive messaging** regardless of exit code

**INFINITE CONTINUE HOOK SYSTEM:**
- **Setup**: `node "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook/setup-infinite-hook.js" "/Users/jeremyparker/Desktop/Claude Coding Projects/infinite-continue-stop-hook"`
- **Coverage**: development (80%), testing/debugging/refactoring (95%)
- **Stop Control**: API endpoint required for stop authorization
