## üö® CRITICAL MANDATES

### ‚ö° TASK CREATION & EXECUTION PROTOCOL
**üî¥ CRITICAL: INSTANTLY CREATE TASK FOR ANY REQUEST/OPPORTUNITY AND EXECUTE**

**REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **USE TASKMANAGER API** before any other action - Specify category: linter-error, missing-feature, bug, enhancement, research
2. **NO DELAYS** - No thinking/analysis first, create task immediately
3. **EXECUTE COMPLETELY** - Task creation ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Completion
4. **WORK TO COMPLETION** - Never create task and stop without doing the work

**TRIGGERS:** User requests, linter errors (highest priority), build/test failures, bugs, performance/security issues

**GOLDEN RULE:** Request detected ‚Üí **INSTANT TASK CREATION** ‚Üí **FULL EXECUTION**

### üö® MANDATORY TASK QUALITY STANDARDS
**üî¥ ZERO TOLERANCE FOR VAGUE/UNCLEAR TASKS**
