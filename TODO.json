      "description": "Modify the linter recommendation system so that after a task is completed, the linter recommendation becomes the whole feedback/task, not just a part of it. The linter recommendation should encompass the entire feedback mechanism when tasks are completed, rather than being a partial component. This involves updating the feedback generation logic to make linter recommendations the primary and complete feedback rather than supplementary information.",
