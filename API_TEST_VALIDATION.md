# API Test Task Validation Report

**Task ID**: `task_1755641713027_2v8f4752e`  
**Title**: API Test Task  
**Category**: missing-feature  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

## 🎯 Task Objective

This task was created by the `test-api.js` script to validate the REST API functionality of the TaskManager system. The task represents testing and validation of the API endpoints.

## ✅ Validation Results

### Core API Functionality - WORKING ✅

1. **Health Check Endpoint** (`/api/health`)
   - ✅ Status: 200 - Working correctly
   - ✅ Returns proper health status

2. **Task Management Endpoints**
   - ✅ GET `/api/tasks` - Status: 200 - Lists tasks correctly
   - ✅ POST `/api/tasks` - Status: 201 - Creates tasks successfully
   - ✅ GET `/api/tasks/:id` - Status: 200 - Retrieves task details

3. **Statistics Endpoint** (`/api/stats`)
   - ✅ Status: 200 - Returns system statistics

### Issues Identified and Fixed ✅

#### Problem: AgentRegistry Method Mismatch
- **Issue**: API server was calling `agentRegistry.listAgents()` but the method doesn't exist
- **Root Cause**: AgentRegistry class has `getAllAgents()` and `getActiveAgents()` methods, not `listAgents()`
- **Fix Applied**: Updated API server endpoints:
  ```javascript
  // Before (incorrect)
  const agents = await agentRegistry.listAgents();
  
  // After (correct)
  const agents = agentRegistry.getAllAgents();
  ```

#### Endpoints Fixed:
- `/api/status` - Now correctly retrieves agent information
- `/api/agents` - Now properly lists all agents
