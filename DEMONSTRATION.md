# Infinite Continue Hook System Demonstration

## Overview

The infinite continue hook system has been successfully demonstrated. This document explains how the system works and what was showcased.

## What Was Demonstrated

### 1. Simplified Prompt System
- **Reduced prompt size** from ~40KB to ~13KB
- **Shortened general.md** to 77 lines with clear reading instructions
- **Removed redundant instructions** from the hook system

### 2. Project-Local Mode Files
- Setup script now creates `/development/modes/` directory
- Copies all mode files to each project
- Allows project-specific customization

### 3. Demo Project Created
Located in `/demo` directory with:
- **calculator.js**: Module with intentional bugs
- **calculator.test.js**: Incomplete test suite (40% coverage)
- **demonstrate-hook.js**: Interactive demonstration script
- **README.md**: Demo documentation

### 4. Key Features Shown

#### Mode Alternation
- First stop: Task mode (DEVELOPMENT)
- Second stop: TASK_CREATION mode
- Continues alternating to ensure regular task decomposition

#### Automatic Mode Detection
The system would detect:
- Low test coverage → Switch to TESTING mode
- Failing tests → Switch to DEBUGGING mode
- High complexity → Switch to REFACTORING mode
- Missing docs → Switch to DOCUMENTATION mode

#### Task Management
- TODO.json tracks all tasks
- Tasks marked `in_progress` when started
- Review strikes ensure quality gates

## How to Use the Demo

1. **Navigate to demo directory**:
   ```bash
   cd demo
   ```

2. **Run the demonstration**:
   ```bash
   node demonstrate-hook.js
   ```

3. **Try the hook yourself**:
   - In Claude Code, try to stop while in the demo directory
   - The hook will activate and provide guidance
   - Complete tasks and observe mode transitions

## System Improvements Made

### Before
- Large monolithic general.md (773 lines)
- All mode content embedded in prompts
- ~40KB prompt size
- No project customization

### After
- Concise general.md (77 lines) with reading instructions
- Mode files copied to each project
- ~13KB prompt size
- Full project customization capability

## Testing the Hook

The hook has been tested and is working correctly:
- Prompt size reduced by 67%
- Mode alternation functioning
- Task tracking operational
- Project directories created successfully

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Demonstrated hook functionality working with TODO.json tasks
✅ Created working demo project
✅ Showed mode switching capabilities
✅ Documented the system comprehensively
✅ Reduced prompt size significantly
