## 🚨 Known Issues and Limitations

### Test Suite Compatibility
The current test suite was designed for the previous task-based API and needs updates:

1. **API Tests** - Tests expect task-based commands but API uses feature-based commands
2. **Performance Tests** - Same API compatibility issues
3. **Integration Tests** - Need updating for new workflow

### Linting Issues
Non-critical linting warnings in development files:
- Console statements in performance analysis scripts
- Security warnings in development tools
- Unused variables in some test files

### Coverage Targets
Current coverage is below targets due to:
- Large codebase with many untested modules
- API transition leaving some code paths untested
- Development tools not included in coverage targets

## 🎯 Quality Gate Effectiveness
