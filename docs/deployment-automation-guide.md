## Deployment Workflows

### 1. Release & Deployment Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/release-deployment.yml`

This is the main deployment workflow that orchestrates the entire release process.

#### Trigger Conditions

- **Tag-based releases**: Automatically triggered on version tags (`v*.*.*`)
- **Manual dispatch**: Triggered via GitHub Actions UI with customizable parameters

#### Workflow Jobs

1. **Release Validation & Preparation**
   - Validates release prerequisites
   - Determines version and environment
   - Generates release notes
   - Creates artifact metadata

2. **Quality Gates**
   - Runs comprehensive test suite
   - Validates coverage thresholds
   - Performs security audit
   - Checks application startup

3. **Build & Package Artifacts**
   - Creates production build
   - Generates deployment archive
   - Creates checksums and metadata
   - Uploads to artifact registry

4. **Environment-Specific Deployment**
   - Downloads and verifies artifacts
   - Configures environment
   - Executes deployment
   - Runs post-deployment health checks

5. **GitHub Release Creation**
   - Creates GitHub release (for production)
   - Uploads release assets
   - Publishes release notes

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Manual deployment to staging
gh workflow run release-deployment.yml \
  -f environment=staging \
  -f version_type=patch \
  -f create_release=false

# Production deployment (tag-triggered)
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

### 2. Artifact Management Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/artifact-management.yml`

Manages the lifecycle of deployment artifacts.

#### Supported Operations

- **Store**: Upload and catalog artifacts
- **Retrieve**: Download specific artifact versions
- **Cleanup**: Remove expired artifacts
- **Promote**: Move artifacts between environments
- **Validate**: Check artifact integrity

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Store an artifact
gh workflow run artifact-management.yml \
  -f action=store \
  -f artifact_name=taskmanager-v1.2.3-staging-20241201 \
  -f environment=staging

# Cleanup expired artifacts
gh workflow run artifact-management.yml \
  -f action=cleanup \
  -f cleanup_days=30
```

### 3. Rollback Automation

**File**: `.github/workflows/rollback-automation.yml`

Provides automated rollback capabilities for failed deployments.

#### Rollback Process

1. **Preparation & Validation**
   - Analyzes current deployment state
   - Validates rollback target
   - Creates rollback plan

2. **Pre-Rollback Backup**
   - Backs up current state
   - Verifies backup integrity
   - Prepares restoration point

3. **Rollback Execution**
   - Retrieves target version
   - Executes deployment rollback
   - Runs health checks

4. **Post-Rollback Monitoring**
   - Monitors application metrics
   - Generates rollback report
   - Sends notifications

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Emergency rollback
gh workflow run rollback-automation.yml \
  -f deployment_id=deploy-12345 \
  -f environment=production \
  -f rollback_reason=critical_bug

# Rollback to specific version
gh workflow run rollback-automation.yml \
  -f deployment_id=deploy-12345 \
  -f environment=staging \
  -f rollback_reason=performance_degradation \

## Rollback Mechanisms

### Automated Rollback Triggers

The system automatically triggers rollbacks based on:

1. **Health Check Failures**
   - API endpoint failures
   - Application startup failures
   - Database connectivity issues

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Response time above thresholds
   - High error rates
   - Resource exhaustion

3. **Security Incidents**
   - Security scan failures
   - Vulnerability detection
   - Compliance violations

### Rollback Process

1. **Detection**: Monitoring systems detect issues
2. **Assessment**: Automated analysis of failure severity
3. **Decision**: Auto-rollback for critical issues
4. **Execution**: Automated rollback to last known good state
5. **Verification**: Health checks confirm successful rollback
6. **Notification**: Alert stakeholders of rollback completion

### Manual Rollback

Emergency rollbacks can be triggered manually:

```bash
# Critical production issue
gh workflow run rollback-automation.yml \
  -f deployment_id=latest \
  -f environment=production \
  -f rollback_reason=critical_bug \
  -f force_rollback=true
```
