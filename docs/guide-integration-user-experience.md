$ timeout 10s node taskmanager-api.js claim task_789
{
  "success": false,
  "reason": "Task has incomplete dependencies",
  "blockedByDependencies": true,
  "incompleteDependencies": [{"id": "task_456", "title": "Setup database"}]
}

# Developer confused about workflow
# Must manually figure out dependency chain
# No guidance on resolution order
```

#### After Guide Integration
```bash
# Same scenario with dependency guidance
$ timeout 10s node taskmanager-api.js claim task_789
{
  "success": false,
  "reason": "Task has incomplete dependencies",

```bash
# First-time user gets comprehensive guidance
$ timeout 10s node taskmanager-api.js init
# Response includes full quickStart, detailed help, examples

# Experienced user gets minimal guidance
$ timeout 10s node taskmanager-api.js init --experienced
# Response includes essential commands only

# Error context triggers specific help
$ timeout 10s node taskmanager-api.js create '{"invalid": "data"}'
# Response includes task creation guidance, validation rules, examples
```
