# RAG System Comprehensive Test Suite

This directory contains a complete test suite for the RAG-based lessons and error database system, covering all aspects from individual component testing to full system integration and performance validation.

## Overview

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system enables agents to store, search, and retrieve lessons and errors using semantic search capabilities. This test suite ensures the system is reliable, performant, and maintains data integrity under all conditions.

## Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration

The test suite uses Jest with specialized configuration:

- **Environment**: Node.js
- **Timeout**: Varies by test type (10s unit, 60s integration, 5min performance)
- **Coverage**: 80% threshold for all metrics
- **Parallel Execution**: Disabled for performance tests
- **Reporters**: HTML, JUnit, and console output

### Performance Thresholds

- **Embedding Generation**: < 2 seconds per item
- **Semantic Search**: < 500ms response time
- **Batch Operations**: < 100ms per item
- **Database Queries**: < 1 second
- **Migration**: Progress tracking with reasonable completion times

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js 16+ installed
2. RAG system implementation available
3. Test database configured
4. Required dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest supertest jest-html-reporters jest-junit
```

### Basic Test Execution

```bash
# Run all RAG tests
npm run test:rag

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:rag:unit
npm run test:rag:integration
npm run test:rag:performance
npm run test:rag:integrity

# Run with coverage
npm run test:rag:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:rag:watch
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Run specific test file
npx jest test/rag-system/unit/api-endpoints.test.js

# Run with verbose output
npx jest --verbose test/rag-system/

# Run performance tests only
npx jest --testPathPattern=performance

# Generate coverage report
npx jest --coverage test/rag-system/
```

## Test Data Management

### Mock Data

The test suite includes comprehensive mock implementations for:

- Embedding service responses
- Vector database operations
- RAG system functionality
- Performance metrics

### Test Datasets

- **Technical Content**: Real-world code snippets and documentation
- **Error Examples**: Actual error messages and stack traces
- **Lesson Samples**: Existing development/lessons content
- **Synthetic Data**: Generated content for scale testing

- Test directories are removed after execution
- Mock data is reset between tests
- Database transactions are rolled back
- Memory usage is monitored and managed

## Contributing

### Adding New Tests

1. **Choose appropriate category**: unit, integration, performance, or data-integrity
2. **Follow naming conventions**: descriptive test names with category prefix
3. **Use test utilities**: Leverage existing mocks and helpers
4. **Include documentation**: Comment complex test logic
5. **Verify cleanup**: Ensure tests don't leave artifacts

### Test Guidelines

- **Isolation**: Each test should be independent
- **Clarity**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested
- **Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive coverage of happy and error paths
