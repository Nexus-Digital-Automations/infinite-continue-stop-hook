# Audit Standards and Objectivity Rules

## Overview
This file defines objectivity rules, standards, and protocols for audit agents within the embedded subtasks system. It ensures independent, unbiased quality validation and maintains audit integrity through clear agent separation and assessment criteria.

## Core Audit Principles

### 🎯 Objectivity Mandates
1. **Agent Independence**: Audit agents MUST be different from implementation agents
2. **Unbiased Assessment**: Evaluate against standards, not personal preferences
3. **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Base conclusions on measurable criteria and concrete evidence
4. **Transparent Process**: Document all findings, reasoning, and decisions clearly
5. **Consistent Standards**: Apply same standards across all tasks and agents

### 🔒 Audit Integrity Rules
- **No Self-Auditing**: Agents cannot audit their own implementation work
- **Single Responsibility**: Audit agents focus exclusively on quality validation
- **Standard Compliance**: Follow audit criteria from audit-criteria.md exactly
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Evaluate ALL success criteria without exception
- **Objective Documentation**: Document findings without bias or subjective interpretation

## Audit Agent Assignment Protocol

### 🎲 Agent Selection Rules
```json
{
  "agent_assignment_rules": {
    "independence_requirement": {
      "rule": "Audit agent MUST be different from implementation agent",
      "validation": "Compare agent IDs - must not match",
      "enforcement": "System automatically prevents self-assignment"
    },
    "specialization_matching": {
      "rule": "Prefer audit agents with relevant technical specialization",
      "frontend_tasks": "Frontend-specialized audit agents preferred",
      "backend_tasks": "Backend-specialized audit agents preferred",

  "audit_scoring": {
    "mandatory_criteria": {
      "weight": 60,
      "passing_score": 100,
      "description": "All mandatory criteria must pass - no exceptions"

    },
    "overall_passing_score": 95,
    "failure_threshold": "Any mandatory criteria failure = automatic rejection"
  }
}
```

## Audit Execution Protocol

### 🚀 Audit Workflow
1. **Audit Assignment**: System assigns independent audit agent automatically
2. **Context Review**: Audit agent reviews original implementation task and requirements
3. **Evidence Collection**: Gather all validation evidence and test results
4. **Criteria Evaluation**: Systematically evaluate each audit criterion
5. **Decision Making**: Make pass/fail decision based on objective assessment
6. **Documentation**: Document findings, decision, and any required actions
7. **Handoff**: Return control to system with clear resolution status

### Audit Execution Sequence
```bash
# Step 1: Environment Preparation
cd /project/root
git status  # Verify clean working directory

# Step 2: Mandatory Validation
npm run lint    # Must pass with zero violations
npm run build   # Must complete without errors  
npm test        # All existing tests must pass
npm start       # Application must start successfully

# Step 3: Implementation Review
read implemented_files  # Review all modified files
grep "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX" src/  # Check for incomplete work
find . -name "*.log" -o -name "*.tmp"  # Check for development artifacts

# Step 4: Documentation Validation
check function_documentation  # Verify comprehensive documentation
check api_documentation      # Verify public interface documentation  
check architecture_docs      # Verify design decisions documented

# Step 5: Security Validation  
grep -r "password\|secret\|key" src/  # Check for credential exposure
check input_validation       # Verify input sanitization
check error_handling        # Verify appropriate error handling

# Step 6: Evidence Documentation
document_audit_results      # Create comprehensive audit report
```

## Escalation Procedures

### 🚨 When to Escalate
- **Complex Technical Issues**: Implementation involves complex architecture decisions
- **Disputed Results**: Implementation agent disagrees with audit findings
- **Unclear Standards**: Audit criteria unclear or conflicting
- **Novel Approaches**: Implementation uses approaches not covered by standards
- **Security Concerns**: Potential security issues require expert review

### Escalation Process
1. **Document Issue**: Clearly describe the complex issue or dispute
2. **Gather Evidence**: Collect all relevant technical evidence and context
3. **Request Review**: Formally request senior agent or committee review
4. **Provide Context**: Include original requirements, implementation details, and audit findings
5. **Await Decision**: Hold implementation pending escalation resolution
6. **Implement Resolution**: Follow escalation decision and update standards if needed
