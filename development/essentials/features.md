- [x] **Infinite Continue Hook** - Never-stop protocol with endpoint-based stop control
- [x] **Multi-Agent Support** - Concurrent agent coordination with task claiming system
- [x] **Task Categorization** - Priority-based task sorting (linter-error ‚Üí build-error ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí research ‚Üí testing)
- [x] **Dependency System** - Task dependency management with automatic blocking and resolution
- [x] **Agent Registry** - Dynamic agent registration, heartbeat monitoring, and stale agent cleanup
- [x] **Task Status Validation** - Real-time task status tracking and validation

### Development Infrastructure
- [x] **Comprehensive Logging System** - Enterprise-grade logging with structured formatting and debugging support
- [x] **Git Integration** - Automatic commit and push workflow with standardized commit messages
- [x] **Research Report Integration** - Mandatory research report reading before implementation
- [x] **Code Quality Enforcement** - Zero-tolerance linting and validation requirements
- [x] **Settings Protection** - Absolute prohibition on modifying global Claude settings
- [x] **Integrated API Guide System** - Comprehensive guide automatically included in initialization, reinitialization, and error responses with contextual help
- [x] **Enhanced Task Creation Mandates** - Interrupt-based task creation with documentation update requirements and team dependability emphasis
- [x] **Root Folder Organization System** - Professional developer protocol compliance with organized development subdirectories (debug-logs, test-reports, temp-scripts, analysis)
- [x] **Perfectionist Linter Warning-as-Error Protocols** - Zero-tolerance linter perfectionist mandates treating all warnings as critical errors
- [x] **CLAUDE.md Documentation Consolidation & Immediate Action Protocol** - Streamlined project documentation from 596 to 305 lines while removing duplications with TaskManager API guide and stop hook feedback. Enhanced immediate action protocol with explicit mandate that every user message requiring action triggers immediate initialization and task creation.
- [x] **Phase System for Features** - Sequential phase tracking system (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.) EXCLUSIVELY for feature tasks with comprehensive API endpoints (create-phase, update-phase, progress-phase, list-phases, current-phase, phase-stats), validation, and documentation. Enables timeline management and project organization for complex feature development.
- [x] **Intelligent Dialogue & Critical Thinking System** - Comprehensive dialogue intelligence system enabling agents to think independently, question unclear requests, engage in constructive dialogue, and infer user intent from typos/mistakes. Includes critical analysis mandates, dialogue protocols, typo inference examples, and professional tone guidelines. Implemented in CLAUDE.md lines 76-122.
- [x] **Reinitialize-Only Logic Flow for Stop Hook System** - Intelligent auto-detection reinitialize command that works for all scenarios (fresh projects, stale agents, active agents). Eliminates confusion between init vs reinitialize by making reinitialize handle all cases through agent scenario detection. Designed to replace tm-universal.js references with unified taskmanager-api.js reinitialize command. Features comprehensive auto-detection logic, graceful fallbacks, and enhanced error handling for seamless user experience across all project states.
- [x] **Mandatory Git Workflow Requirements** - Comprehensive commit and push requirements integrated into CLAUDE.md task completion protocols. Mandates all changes must be committed and pushed to remote before marking tasks complete. Includes git workflow standards with conventional commit messages, proper attribution, and zero-tolerance for uncommitted changes. Features complete git command sequences, troubleshooting protocols, and integration with existing task validation workflows.
- [x] **Intelligent Research Task System** - Comprehensive research automation system with codebase analysis, internet search integration, report generation, and research location targeting for automated intelligence gathering. Features AI-powered CodebaseAnalyzer for deep code understanding and pattern recognition, WebResearchEngine for multi-source internet research with content analysis, ReportGenerator for template-based comprehensive reports, LocationTargeting for intelligent path discovery and relevance scoring, and DeliverableTracker for progress monitoring and completion validation. Fully integrated with existing TaskManager research workflow and embedded subtasks system.

### Hook System
- [x] **Stop Hook Implementation** - Infinite continue mode with instructive task guidance
- [x] **Stop Authorization API** - Endpoint-based single-use stop authorization
- [x] **Task Completion Tracking** - Evidence-based completion protocol with validation requirements

## ‚ùì Potential Features Awaiting User Verification

*This section is for Claude Code agents to propose new features for user review and approval.*

### Instructions for Agents:
1. **Before adding features here**: Always read this file first to avoid duplicating existing features
2. **Feature format**: Use clear titles, descriptions, and rationale
3. **User approval required**: Features in this section require explicit user approval before moving to "Planned Features"
4. **Implementation**: Only implement features that have been approved and moved to "Planned Features"

### Proposed Features:

#### User Management System
**Description**: Comprehensive user management functionality including user profiles, authentication, authorization, and user data management integrated with existing OAuth 2.0 system
**Rationale**: The OAuth 2.0 authentication system is already implemented (as evidenced in research-report-task_1755639998690_g7jzz80wu.md) but lacks the user management layer needed for a complete authentication system. User management is essential for any application requiring user accounts, profiles, and access control.
**Implementation Effort**: Medium - builds on existing OAuth infrastructure
**Dependencies**: OAuth 2.0 authentication system (already implemented), database schema design
**Proposed by**: development_session_1756276145521_1_general_dece607d on 2025-08-27

```markdown
#### Feature Name
**Description**: Brief description of the feature
**Rationale**: Why this feature would be beneficial
**Implementation Effort**: Estimated complexity (Low/Medium/High)
**Dependencies**: Any required dependencies or prerequisites
**Proposed by**: Agent ID and date
```

## üîß Feature Implementation Workflow

### For Claude Code Agents:

1. **Feature Discovery Phase**:
   - **MANDATORY**: Always read this features.md file before starting any work
   - Check if the feature already exists in any section
   - Review TODO.json for related implementation tasks

2. **Feature Proposal Process**:
   - If you identify a beneficial feature not listed above
   - Add it to "‚ùì Potential Features Awaiting User Verification" section
   - Use the specified format with clear description and rationale
   - Do NOT implement proposed features without user approval

3. **Feature Implementation Process**:
   - Only implement features from "üìã Planned Features" section
   - Move implemented features to "‚úÖ Implemented Features" when complete
   - Update implementation status and provide completion details

### For Users:

1. **Feature Review Process**:
   - Review "‚ùì Potential Features Awaiting User Verification" section regularly
   - Approve valuable features by moving them to "üìã Planned Features"
   - Remove or modify features that don't align with project goals

2. **Feature Planning**:
   - Prioritize features in "üìã Planned Features" section
   - Add specific implementation requirements or constraints
   - Create corresponding tasks in TODO.json when ready for implementation
