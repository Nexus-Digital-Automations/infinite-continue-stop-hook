# Research Task Guidelines and Configuration

## Overview

This file defines comprehensive guidelines for research tasks within the embedded subtasks system, including research methodologies, configuration standards, reporting requirements, and integration protocols.

## Research Task Framework

### üîç Research Task Definition

Research tasks are automatically generated for complex feature implementations requiring comprehensive analysis before development begins. They serve as critical intelligence-gathering phases that prevent implementation errors and ensure optimal technical approaches.

### Core Research Principles

1. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Cover all relevant technical, architectural, and business aspects
2. **Multi-Source Investigation**: Combine codebase analysis, internet research, and documentation review
3. **Objective Assessment**: Provide unbiased analysis of options and approaches
4. **Implementation-Ready Deliverables**: Generate actionable insights for implementation teams
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Identify potential issues and challenges before implementation
