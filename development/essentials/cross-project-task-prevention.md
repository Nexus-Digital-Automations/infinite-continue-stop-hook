# Cross-Project Task Assignment Prevention

## Issue Identified

**Date**: 2025-09-07
**Task ID**: error_1757281637255_44et208uc  
**Problem**: Task was created referencing files from AIgent project but assigned to infinite-continue-stop-hook project

## Root Cause

Tasks can be incorrectly created with important_files paths pointing to different projects, violating CLAUDE.md project directory restrictions (lines 232-237).

## Prevention Measures

### For Task Creation

- **VALIDATE file paths** before creating tasks
- **ENSURE all important_files** exist within current project directory
- **VERIFY task scope** matches current project capabilities
- **CROSS-CHECK file accessibility** before task assignment

### For Agents

- **IMMEDIATELY REPORT** tasks referencing external project files
- **CREATE ERROR TASKS** to document cross-project assignment issues
- **COMPLETE with honest explanation** rather than attempting invalid operations
- **FOLLOW CLAUDE.md directory restrictions** strictly

## Project Scope Validation

**infinite-continue-stop-hook** project scope:

- Task management and agent coordination
- Hook system for continuous operation
- Local-only architecture (already implemented)
- No cloud dependencies or Kubernetes components

## Resolution Protocol

1. Identify cross-project file references
2. Create error task documenting the issue
3. Complete original task with explanation
4. Document prevention measures (this file)
5. Advise user to properly scope future tasks

## Technical Notes

- infinite-continue-stop-hook project has no cloud components to refactor
- All references to Docker/cloud in documentation are examples only
- Project operates entirely locally with file-based task management
