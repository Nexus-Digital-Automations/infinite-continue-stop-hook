## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Coverage Testing
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
npm run coverage

npm run coverage:ci
```

### Validation and Quality Gates
```bash
# Standalone threshold validation
npm run coverage:check:standalone

npm run coverage:check:strict

# Complete quality check (lint + coverage + performance)
npm run ci:quality-check
```

### Report Generation
```bash
# Generate specific report formats
npm run coverage:report     # HTML + text summary
npm run coverage:json       # JSON format
npm run coverage:lcov       # LCOV format

# Generate coverage badge
npm run coverage:badge

# Monitor coverage trends
npm run coverage:monitor
```

coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    branches: 75,
    functions: 80,
    lines: 80,
    statements: 80
  },

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Threshold Validation
```bash
# Override thresholds via CLI
node scripts/coverage-check.js --thresholds='{"lines":85,"functions":85}'

# Enable strict mode
node scripts/coverage-check.js --strict

# Environment variables
STRICT_MODE=true npm run coverage:check:standalone

```

## 🚨 Quality Gates

### Threshold Enforcement
- **✅ PASS**: All metrics meet target thresholds
- **⚠️ WARNING**: Metrics between critical and target thresholds
- **❌ CRITICAL**: Metrics below critical thresholds (blocks deployment)

### Strict Mode
When enabled, warnings also cause failure:
```bash
npm run coverage:check:strict
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions integration
- name: Coverage Validation
  run: npm run coverage:check:standalone

- name: Generate Coverage Badge
  run: npm run coverage:badge
```

## 📋 Coverage Analysis

### Current File Coverage
- **taskmanager-api.js**: 84.73% coverage (1099/1297 lines)
- **Functions**: 29/31 covered (93.54%)
- **Branches**: 126/146 covered (86.30%)

### Coverage Gaps
To improve coverage, focus on:
1. **Uncovered branches**: 20 branches need test coverage
2. **Uncovered functions**: 2 functions need testing
3. **Uncovered lines**: 198 lines need coverage

### Viewing Detailed Coverage
```bash
# Open interactive HTML report
npm run coverage:html

# Generate and view JSON data
npm run coverage:json
cat coverage/coverage-summary.json | jq
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Coverage Not Generated
```bash
# Ensure tests run first
npm test
npm run coverage

# Or use CI command that auto-generates
npm run coverage:ci
```

#### Threshold Failures
```bash
# Check detailed validation report
npm run coverage:check:standalone

# View validation details
cat coverage/threshold-validation.json | jq
```

#### Performance Issues
```bash
# Use faster V8 coverage provider (already configured)
# Reduce test scope for development
npm run test:unit:coverage  # Unit tests only
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug output
DEBUG=true npm run coverage:check:standalone

# Enable quiet mode (CI)
QUIET=true npm run coverage:check:standalone
```
