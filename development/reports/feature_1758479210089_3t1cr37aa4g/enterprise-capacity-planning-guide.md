## 3. Infrastructure Sizing Guidelines

### Compute Sizing Formula

#### CPU Requirements
```
Base CPU = 0.5 cores
Task Processing = tasks * 0.0001 cores
Agent Coordination = concurrent_agents * 0.01 cores
Subtask Processing = subtasks * 0.00005 cores

Total CPU = Base + Task + Agent + Subtask

Examples:
- 100 tasks, 10 agents, 200 subtasks = 0.5 + 0.01 + 0.1 + 0.01 = 0.62 cores
- 1000 tasks, 50 agents, 2000 subtasks = 0.5 + 0.1 + 0.5 + 0.1 = 1.2 cores
- 5000 tasks, 200 agents, 10000 subtasks = 0.5 + 0.5 + 2.0 + 0.5 = 3.5 cores
```

#### Memory Requirements
```
Base Memory = 512MB
Task Data = tasks * 4KB
Subtask Data = subtasks * 1.1KB
Agent State = concurrent_agents * 100KB
Cache Overhead = (Task Data + Subtask Data) * 0.5

Total Memory = Base + Task + Subtask + Agent + Cache

Examples:
- 100 tasks, 200 subtasks, 10 agents = 512MB + 400KB + 220KB + 1MB + 310KB ≈ 514MB
- 1000 tasks, 2000 subtasks, 50 agents = 512MB + 4MB + 2.2MB + 5MB + 3.1MB ≈ 527MB
- 5000 tasks, 10000 subtasks, 200 agents = 512MB + 20MB + 11MB + 20MB + 15.5MB ≈ 579MB
```

#### Storage Requirements
```
Active Data = tasks * 4KB + subtasks * 1.1KB
Historical Data = active_data * historical_retention_factor
Backup Storage = (Active + Historical) * backup_retention_factor
Index Storage = Active Data * 0.2 (for search indexes)

Total Storage = Active + Historical + Backup + Index

Retention Factors:
- Historical: 3-10x (depending on retention policy)
- Backup: 2-5x (depending on backup strategy)

Examples:
- 100 tasks: 620KB active, 6MB historical, 13MB backup = 20MB total
- 1000 tasks: 6.2MB active, 62MB historical, 136MB backup = 204MB total
- 5000 tasks: 31MB active, 310MB historical, 682MB backup = 1GB+ total
```

### Performance Scaling Projections

#### Query Performance Scaling
```
Linear File Scanning: O(n) where n = total tasks
With Indexing: O(log n) for indexed queries, O(1) for cached queries
With Database: O(log n) with proper indexing, O(1) for cached aggregates

Performance Projections:
- 100 tasks: <1ms (all architectures)
- 1000 tasks: <5ms (file), <2ms (database)
- 5000 tasks: <25ms (file), <5ms (database)
- 10000 tasks: >50ms (file), <10ms (database)
```

#### Concurrent Operation Scaling
```
File Locking Contention:
- 10 concurrent: <5% wait time
- 50 concurrent: 10-20% wait time
- 100+ concurrent: >30% wait time (bottleneck)

Database Concurrency:
- Connection pooling eliminates most contention
- Proper indexing maintains performance
- Horizontal scaling available for unlimited concurrency
```

#### Memory Usage Scaling
```
File-Based Memory Growth:
- Linear with total data size
- Full JSON loading required
- 1.5x overhead for processing

Database Memory Growth:
- Constant base memory usage
- Query result caching
- Connection pooling overhead minimal
```
