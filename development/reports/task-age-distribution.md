# Task Age Distribution Analysis

## Data Analysis Summary (90 Total Tasks)

### Task Age Categories

| Age Range | Task Count | Status Distribution | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| 0-6 hours | 82 | 45 completed, 32 pending, 5 in_progress | **NORMAL OPERATION** |
| 6-24 hours | 3 | 2 completed, 1 pending | Acceptable |
| 1-7 days | 2 | 2 pending | Potentially stale |
| **7-14+ days** | **3** | **3 in_progress** | **CRITICAL FAILURE** |

### Critical Stale Tasks (Detailed)

| Task ID | Age (Days) | Age (Hours) | Created Date | Agent Session | Status |
|---------|------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| task_1757147866098_53rugpld1 | 14.35 | 344.5 | 2025-09-06 08:37 | dev_session_1757147845572_1_general_bb15ec8e | in_progress |
| task_1757149228788_he8nk6i2t | 14.34 | 344.1 | 2025-09-06 09:00 | dev_session_1757149209264_1_general_b6c6d8b5 | in_progress |
| error_1757363303096_3z4paj87k | 11.85 | 284.4 | 2025-09-08 20:28 | dev_session_1757363286518_1_general_f0b6e6b8 | in_progress |

### Pattern Analysis

**Recent Tasks (0-6 hours)**: 91.1% of all tasks
- Proper lifecycle management
- Active cleanup functionality
- Normal completion rates

**Problematic Tasks (7+ days)**: 3.3% of all tasks
- **ZERO cleanup attempts recorded**
- All remain "in_progress" with dead agent assignments
- Represent complete system failure for this cohort

### Cleanup System Performance

**Success Rate by Age:**
- 0-24 hours: ~98% proper management
- 1-7 days: Degraded but acceptable
- **7+ days: 0% cleanup success (CRITICAL FAILURE)**

**Threshold Violations:**
- Expected cleanup: 30 minutes maximum
- Actual duration: 11-14 days
- **Violation magnitude: 28,000-68,000% over threshold**

### Agent Session Analysis

**Working Agent Sessions (Recent):**
- Pattern: dev_session_1758[timestamp]_1_general_[hash]
- Proper auto_unassign_stale events recorded
- Successful reassignment to new agents

**Failed Agent Sessions (Stale):**
- Pattern: dev_session_1757[timestamp]_1_general_[hash]
- **NO auto_unassign_stale events**
- Sessions from September 6-8, 2025
- Complete abandonment by cleanup system

### Temporal Distribution Insights

1. **Clear Cutoff Date**: September 8, 2025 appears to be the boundary
2. **System State Change**: Cleanup functionality appears to have been restored after September 8
3. **Legacy Problem**: Pre-September 8 tasks were "forgotten" by the system
4. **Current Functionality**: Post-September 8 tasks show proper management

### Immediate Cleanup Requirements

**Manual Intervention Needed:**
1. Reset 3 critical stale tasks to "pending" status
2. Clear assigned_agent fields for dead sessions
3. Add auto_unassign_stale entries to agent_assignment_history
4. Verify no data corruption in TaskManager database

**Prevention Measures:**
1. Implement max task age limits (24-48 hours)
2. Add monitoring for tasks without progress updates
3. Create retroactive cleanup procedures
4. Establish daily stale task audits

**Analysis Completed**: 2025-09-20T17:05:00Z
**Critical Finding**: Stop hook cleanup completely failed for September 6-8 tasks
**Action Required**: Immediate manual intervention for 3 critical stale tasks
