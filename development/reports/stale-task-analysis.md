# Stale Task Data Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
**CRITICAL FINDING**: Multiple extremely stale tasks (11-14 days old) remain assigned to inactive agents, indicating stop hook cleanup system failure. Total dataset: 90 tasks analyzed.

## Analysis Timestamp: 2025-09-20T17:05:00Z

## Key Findings

### 1. EXTREMELY STALE TASKS IDENTIFIED (>10 DAYS OLD)

- Started: 2025-09-08T20:29:14.175Z
- **CLEANUP FAILURE**: Should have been reset after 30 minutes, not 11+ days

- Started: 2025-09-06T09:01:05.926Z
- **CLEANUP FAILURE**: Oldest stale task - 14+ days beyond threshold

**task_1757147866098_53rugpld1**
- Created: 2025-09-06T08:37:46.098Z
- **AGE: 14.35 DAYS (344.5 hours)**
- Status: in_progress
- Assigned: dev_session_1757147845572_1_general_bb15ec8e
- Started: 2025-09-06T08:38:12.274Z
- **CLEANUP FAILURE**: Nearly identical age to above task

### 2. PATTERN ANALYSIS

**Stale Task Characteristics:**
- All extremely stale tasks are in "in_progress" status
- All have assigned_agent values pointing to inactive sessions
- All have started_at timestamps from 11-14 days ago
- Agent session IDs follow pattern: dev_session_[timestamp]_1_general_[hash]

**Recent vs Stale Comparison:**
- Recent tasks (today): Properly managed, completed or reassigned
- Stale tasks (>10 days): Completely abandoned by cleanup system
- Threshold breach: 28,000%+ over 30-minute limit (30 min vs 11+ days)

### 3. CLEANUP SYSTEM FAILURE SCOPE

**Tasks Affected by Age:**
- 0-1 days: 15 tasks (normal operation)
- 1-7 days: 5 tasks (potentially problematic)
- 7-14 days: 3 tasks (CRITICAL FAILURE)
- Total problematic: 8 tasks requiring immediate attention

**Agent Assignment Patterns:**
- Recent agents: Active sessions with proper reassignment
- Stale agents: Sessions from September 6-8, never cleaned up
- Missing cleanup events: No "auto_unassign_stale" entries in agent_assignment_history

### 4. SPECIFIC DURATION CALCULATIONS

**error_1757363303096_3z4paj87k:**
- Duration: 284.4 hours = 11.85 days = 17,064 minutes
- Threshold exceeded by: 56,880% (17,064 min vs 30 min limit)

**task_1757149228788_he8nk6i2t:**
- Duration: 344.1 hours = 14.34 days = 20,646 minutes
- Threshold exceeded by: 68,820% (20,646 min vs 30 min limit)

**task_1757147866098_53rugpld1:**
- Duration: 344.5 hours = 14.35 days = 20,670 minutes
- Threshold exceeded by: 68,900% (20,670 min vs 30 min limit)

## 5. COMPARISON WITH SUCCESSFUL CLEANUPS

**Working Examples Found:**
- error_1758340733705_i1ar4ra9ng: Shows proper auto_unassign_stale at 2025-09-20T04:28:39.092Z
- Reason: "Agent became stale (inactive >30 minutes)"
- **THIS PROVES CLEANUP SYSTEM CAN WORK** - but failed for older tasks

## 6. ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS

**Primary Theory**: Stop hook cleanup system was either:
1. Not running during September 6-8 period
2. Had a bug preventing cleanup of very old tasks
3. Database corruption preventing updates to these specific tasks
4. Agent session tracking failure for these particular sessions

**Evidence Supporting Theory:**
- Recent tasks show proper cleanup functionality
- Stale tasks show NO cleanup attempts in agent_assignment_history
- Clean separation between "working" (recent) and "broken" (old) tasks

## 7. IMMEDIATE REMEDIATION REQUIRED

**High Priority Actions:**
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Reset 3 extremely stale tasks to pending status
2. **URGENT**: Investigate stop hook logic for date-based edge cases
3. **CRITICAL**: Implement retroactive cleanup for abandoned tasks
4. **ESSENTIAL**: Add monitoring to prevent future 10+ day stale tasks

**Data Quality Impact:**
- Task queue integrity compromised
- Resource allocation blocked by phantom assignments
- System reliability degraded by cleanup failures

## 8. RECOMMENDED INVESTIGATION PATHS

1. **Stop Hook Code Review**: Examine cleanup logic for date handling bugs
2. **Database Analysis**: Check for corruption in agent_assignment_history
3. **Session Tracking**: Verify agent session lifecycle management
4. **Monitoring**: Implement alerts for tasks >2 hours without progress
