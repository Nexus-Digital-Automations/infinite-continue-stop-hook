# Root Folder Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully organized the root folder structure according to CLAUDE.md mandatory organization policies, ensuring clean project structure and proper subdirectory organization.

## Actions Taken

### Files Moved to `development/logs/`
- `infinite-continue-hook.log` - Hook execution logs
- `post-tool-linter-hook.log` - Linter hook execution logs  
- `file-operations.log` - File operation tracking logs

### Files Moved to `backups/`
- `TODO.json.backup` - Backup of TODO.json file
- `agent-registry.json.backup.1755623080501` - Agent registry backup with timestamp

### Directory Structure Created/Maintained
- `development/logs/` - Consolidated all log files
- `development/essentials/` - Critical project constraints and architecture decisions
- `development/reports/` - Analysis and status reports
- `development/research-reports/` - Research documentation
- `development/temp-scripts/` - Temporary development scripts
- `development/test-reports/` - Testing results and analysis

## Current Root Directory Status

### Essential Project Files (ALLOWED)
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json` - Node.js dependencies
- `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` - Documentation
- `TODO.json`, `DONE.json` - Task management
- `AGENTS.json` - Core project configuration
- `LICENSE` - Project license

### Configuration Files (ALLOWED)
- `eslint.config.js` - Linting configuration
- `jest.config.js` - Testing configuration
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `.claude-hooks-ignore` - Hook configuration
- `.node-modules-checksums.json` - NPM integrity checks

### Core Application Files (ALLOWED)
- `setup-infinite-hook.js` - Hook setup script
- `stop-hook.js` - Hook management script
- `taskmanager-api.js` - Task management API

### Organized Subdirectories
- `lib/` - Core application modules
- `test/` - Test files and configurations
- `docs/` - Project documentation
- `logs/` - Application logs
- `backups/` - Backup files
- `development/` - Development resources, analysis, and temporary files

## Compliance with CLAUDE.md Requirements

✅ **Root folder cleanliness** - Only essential project files remain in root
✅ **Proper subdirectory organization** - All analysis, reports, and temporary files moved to appropriate subdirectories
✅ **Essential files structure** - Core project constraints documented in `development/essentials/`
✅ **Backup organization** - All backup files consolidated in `backups/` directory
✅ **Log file organization** - All log files consolidated in `development/logs/`

## Benefits

1. **Clean Project Structure** - Root folder contains only essential files that developers need to see immediately
2. **Improved Navigation** - Organized subdirectories make it easier to find specific types of files
3. **Professional Appearance** - Clean root folder structure follows industry best practices
4. **Maintenance Efficiency** - Clear organization makes project maintenance and updates easier
5. **Team Collaboration** - Consistent structure helps team members navigate the project quickly

## Next Steps

The root folder is now properly organized and complies with CLAUDE.md mandatory organization policies. Future development work should maintain this structure by:
- Placing new analysis files in `development/analysis/`
- Moving log files to `development/logs/`
- Organizing backup files in `backups/`
- Documenting critical constraints in `development/essentials/`
