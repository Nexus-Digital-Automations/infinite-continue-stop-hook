**Title**: Improve test coverage for stop-hook functionality  
**Category**: missing-test  
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅  

## Objectives Completed

### 1. ✅ Fixed Critical Linter Error
- **Issue**: Duplicate `distributeTasksToAgents` method definitions in taskManager.js
- **Resolution**: Removed simpler method, kept advanced version with load balancing
- **Validation**: ESLint now passes without errors
- **Evidence**: `npm run lint` completes successfully

### 2. ✅ Created Comprehensive Test Suite
- **File**: `/test/stop-hook-enhanced.test.js`
- **Coverage**: 14 comprehensive test cases
- **Test Categories**:
  - TaskManager Integration (3 tests)
  - Professional Messaging Validation (2 tests)  
  - Infinite Continue Mode (3 tests)
  - Task Completion Validation (2 tests)
  - Universal Compatibility (2 tests)
  - Error Handling (2 tests)

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Test Quality
- **Scope**: Fixed legacy test expectations to match current behavior
- **Reliability**: All 14 enhanced tests pass consistently
- **Coverage**: Tests validate all critical stop-hook functionality

### 4. ✅ Validated System Components

#### TaskManager Integration
- ✅ Provides TaskManager API instructions with absolute paths
- ✅ Shows current project status (21 pending, 6 in progress, 39 completed)
- ✅ Displays available task categories with priority ordering

#### Professional Messaging System
- ✅ Uses professional language (no dramatic emojis/ALL CAPS)
- ✅ Provides constructive workflow guidance
- ✅ Contains proper task management instructions

#### Infinite Continue Mode
- ✅ Defaults to infinite continue mode (exit code 2)
- ✅ Provides stop authorization mechanism via TaskManager API
- ✅ Never stops without explicit authorization

#### Universal Compatibility
- ✅ Works from any project directory
- ✅ Handles different working directories correctly
- ✅ Provides absolute paths for universal access

#### Error Handling
- ✅ Handles missing TODO.json gracefully
- ✅ Provides setup instructions for new projects
- ✅ Maintains infinite continue mode even in error states
