- `/development/essentials/task-requirements.md` - Project-specific validation criteria

## Key Findings

### 1. Comprehensive 25-Point Audit System

**Current Implementation**: The audit system implements a sophisticated 25-point quality assessment framework divided into four priority categories:

- **Critical Gates (1-10)**: MANDATORY criteria including linter perfection, build integrity, runtime success, test coverage, git integration, documentation, error handling, performance, security, and code quality
- **Quality Gates (11-15)**: HIGH PRIORITY criteria covering dependency management, configuration, logging, API contracts, and database integration
- **Integration Gates (16-20)**: MEDIUM PRIORITY criteria for environment compatibility, deployment readiness, data migration, integration testing, and user experience
- **Excellence Gates (21-25)**: LOW PRIORITY criteria addressing monitoring, disaster recovery, scalability, compliance, and knowledge transfer

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive coverage of software quality dimensions
- Priority-based evaluation allowing flexible assessment
- Evidence requirement enforced for all validations
- Integration with project-specific task requirements

**Areas for Enhancement**:
- Automated execution framework needed for criteria 4-25
- Dynamic criteria selection based on task complexity
- Performance optimization for large-scale audits

### 2. Objectivity Enforcement Mechanisms

**Current Controls**:
- **Agent Identity Verification**: System prevents agents from auditing their own implementations
- **Role Pattern Detection**: Analysis of agent IDs to identify role conflicts
- **Audit Assignment Automation**: Automatic assignment of different agents for audit tasks
- **Escalation Protocols**: Defined procedures for audit disputes and failures

**Enforcement Architecture**:
```javascript
// Core objectivity validation
validateAgentObjectivity(implementerAgentId, auditAgentId) {
  // Basic check: different agent IDs
  if (implementerAgentId === auditAgentId) {
    throw new Error('OBJECTIVITY VIOLATION: Self-audit prohibited');
  }
  
  // Advanced check: role pattern analysis
  const implementerRole = this.detectAgentRole(implementerAgentId);
  const auditRole = this.detectAgentRole(auditAgentId);
  
  // Warn on role overlap but allow with documentation
  if (implementerRole === auditRole) {
    console.warn('ROLE OVERLAP WARNING: Consider different specialization');
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

**Agent Role Patterns**:
- **Implementation Agents**: `['development', 'feature', 'implementation']`
- **Audit Agents**: `['audit', 'quality', 'review']`
- **Research Agents**: `['research', 'analysis', 'investigation']`

### 3. Agent Assignment Automation Patterns

**TaskManager Integration**:
The existing TaskManager system provides sophisticated agent coordination through:

- **Distributed Locking**: Prevents race conditions in multi-agent scenarios
- **Agent Registry**: Tracks active agents and their specializations
- **Task Claiming System**: Ensures single-agent ownership with priority-based assignment
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Detects stale agents and enables reassignment

**Audit-Specific Requirements**:
- **Independent Assignment**: Audit agents must be different from implementers
- **Automatic Escalation**: Failed audits trigger remediation task creation
- **Evidence Validation**: All audit decisions require comprehensive evidence
- **Quality Gate Enforcement**: Critical failures block task completion

### 4. Evidence Collection Framework

**Evidence Types**:
- **Screenshots**: Linter output, build logs, test results
- **Log Files**: Startup logs, error logs, performance metrics
- **Reports**: Test coverage, security scans, dependency audits
- **Documentation**: API docs, configuration guides, runbooks

**Collection Automation**:
```javascript
// Automated evidence collection per criteria
async evaluateLinterPerfection(auditDir) {
  const lintOutput = execSync('npm run lint', { encoding: 'utf-8' });
  
  await fs.writeFile(
    path.join(auditDir, 'logs', 'lint_output.log'),
    `Timestamp: ${this.timestamp}\nCommand: npm run lint\n\nOutput:\n${lintOutput}`
  );
  
  return {
    criteria_id: 1,
    status: !hasErrors && !hasWarnings ? 'PASSED' : 'FAILED',
    evidence_location: 'logs/lint_output.log',
    remediation_required: hasErrors || hasWarnings
  };
}
```

**Evidence Standards**:
- **Timestamps**: All evidence includes execution timestamps
- **Reproducibility**: Evidence must be verifiable by audit agents
- **Completeness**: Coverage of all criteria aspects
- **Accuracy**: Reflection of actual system state

### 5. Integration Specifications

**TaskManager API Enhancement Requirements**:

#### A. Audit Task Creation Automation
```javascript
// Automatic audit task creation after feature completion
const auditTaskData = {
  title: `AUDIT: ${originalTask.title} - 25-Point Quality Review`,
  description: generateAuditDescription(originalTaskId, taskDetails),
  category: 'subtask',
  audit_metadata: {
    original_task_id: originalTaskId,
    original_implementer: implementerAgentId,
    prevents_self_review: true,
    objectivity_enforced: true,
    audit_type: 'comprehensive_25_point'
  }
};
```

#### B. Agent Assignment Validation
```javascript
// Objectivity enforcement in task claiming
async claimAuditTask(taskId, agentId) {
  const task = await this.getTask(taskId);
  
  if (task.audit_metadata?.prevents_self_review) {
    if (agentId === task.audit_metadata.original_implementer) {
      return {
        success: false,
        reason: 'OBJECTIVITY_VIOLATION: Cannot audit own implementation'
      };
    }
  }
  
  return this.claimTask(taskId, agentId);
}
```

#### C. Evidence Integration System
```javascript
// Evidence collection during audit execution
async collectAuditEvidence(taskId, criteriaResults) {
  const auditDir = path.join('development/reports', `audit_${taskId}`);
  
  for (const [criteriaId, result] of Object.entries(criteriaResults)) {
    await this.saveEvidence(auditDir, criteriaId, result.evidence);
  }
  
  return { evidenceDir: auditDir, totalFiles: evidenceCount };
}
```

### 6. Audit Workflow Integration
