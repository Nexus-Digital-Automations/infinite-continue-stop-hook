# Cross-Project Task Assignment Error

## Error Details
**Date**: 2025-09-18  
**Task ID**: test_1758041284495_y8wsca215  
**Agent ID**: dev_session_1758223743965_1_general_7d87022d  
**Problem**: Task references React Portfolio page and ErrorBoundary components that don't exist in this project

## Investigation
The task "CRITICAL ERROR: Fix Portfolio page Error Boundary cascade failures" was assigned to the infinite-continue-stop-hook project, but this project is:
- A Node.js task management API system
- Has no React components, Portfolio pages, or ErrorBoundary components
- Contains only taskmanager-api.js, stop-hook.js, and related task management files

## Evidence
- No Portfolio-related files found: `find . -name "*Portfolio*" -o -name "*portfolio*"`
- No React/ErrorBoundary references: `grep -r "ErrorBoundary" . --include="*.js"`
- package.json shows this is "claude-taskmanager" - a universal TaskManager API

## Root Cause
This appears to be a cross-project task assignment where a task meant for a React portfolio website was incorrectly assigned to the task management system project.

## Resolution
Following cross-project-task-prevention.md guidelines:
1. Document the issue (this file)
2. Complete original task with honest explanation
3. Advise proper task scoping

## Prevention
- Validate task scope matches project capabilities before assignment
- Ensure task descriptions reference files that exist in current project directory
- Follow CLAUDE.md project directory restrictions
